	or phantasy into which it plunges, spurred on either
	by the love of gain, the necessity of excitement, or
	the mere force of imitation. Failing in these, it has
	some madness, to which it is goaded by political or
	religious causes, or both combined. Every one of
	these causes influenced the Crusades, and conspired
	to render them the most extraordinary instance upon
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"></a>record of the extent to which popular enthusiasm can be carried.
	History in her solemn page informs us, that the Crusaders were but
	ignorant and savage men, that their motives were those of bigotry
	unmitigated, and that their pathway was one of blood and tears.
	Romance, on the other hand, dilates upon their piety and heroism,
	and portrays, in her most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue
	and magnanimity, the imperishable honour they acquired for themselves,
	and the great services they rendered to Christianity. In the
	following pages we shall ransack the stores of both, to discover the
	true spirit that animated the motley multitude who took up arms in
	the service of the cross, leaving history to vouch for facts, but not disdaining
	the aid of contemporary poetry and romance, to throw light
	upon feelings, motives, and opinions.</p>

	<p>In order to understand thoroughly the state of public feeling in
	Europe at the time when Peter the Hermit preached the holy war, it
	will be necessary to go back for many years anterior to that event.
	We must make acquaintance with the pilgrims of the eighth, ninth,
	and tenth centuries, and learn the tales they told of the dangers they
	had passed and the wonders they had seen. Pilgrimages to the Holy
	Land seem at first to have been undertaken by converted Jews, and
	by Christian devotees of lively imagination, pining with a natural curiosity
	to visit the scenes which of all others were most interesting in
	their eyes. The pious and the impious alike flocked to Jerusalem,—the
	one class to feast their sight on the scenes hallowed by the life
	and sufferings of their Lord, and the other, because it soon became
	a generally received opinion, that such a pilgrimage was sufficient to
	rub off the long score of sins, however atrocious. Another and very
	numerous class of pilgrims were the idle and roving, who visited Palestine
	then as the moderns visit Italy or Switzerland now, because
	it was the fashion, and because they might please their vanity by retailing,
	on their return, the adventures they had met with. But the
	really pious formed the great majority. Every year their numbers
	increased, until at last they became so numerous as to be called the
	“armies of the Lord.” Full of enthusiasm, they set the dangers and
	difficulties of the way at defiance, and lingered with holy rapture on
	every scene described by the Evangelists. To them it was bliss indeed
	to drink the clear waters of the Jordan, or be baptised in the
	same stream where John had baptised the Saviour. They wandered
	with awe and pleasure in the purlieus of the Temple, on the solemn
	Mount of Olives, or the awful Calvary, where a God had bled for sinful
	men. To these pilgrims every object was precious. Relics were
	eagerly sought after; flagons of water from Jordan, or panniers of
	mould from the hill of the Crucifixion, were brought home, and sold
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"></a>at extravagant prices to churches and monasteries. More apocryphal
	relics, such as the wood of the true cross, the tears of the Virgin
	Mary, the hems of her garments, the toe-nails and hair of the Apostles—even
	the tents that Paul had helped to manufacture—were
	exhibited for sale by the knavish in Palestine, and brought back to
	Europe “with wondrous cost and care.” A grove of a hundred oaks
	would not have furnished all the wood sold in little morsels as remnants
	of the true cross; and the tears of Mary, if collected together,
	would have filled a cistern.</p>

	<p>For upwards of two hundred years the pilgrims met with no impediment
	in Palestine. The enlightened Haroun Al Reschid, and his
	more immediate successors, encouraged the stream which brought
	so much wealth into Syria, and treated the wayfarers with the utmost
	courtesy. The race of Fatemite caliphs,—who, although in
	other respects as tolerant, were more distressed for money, or more
	unscrupulous in obtaining it, than their predecessors of the house of
	Abbas,—imposed a tax of a bezant for each pilgrim that entered
	Jerusalem. This was a serious hardship upon the poorer sort, who
	had begged their weary way across Europe, and arrived at the bourne
	of all their hopes without a coin. A great outcry was immediately
	raised, but still the tax was rigorously levied. The pilgrims unable
	to pay were compelled to remain at the gate of the holy city until
	some rich devotee arriving with his train, paid the tax and let them
	in. Robert of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror, who,
	in common with many other nobles of the highest rank, undertook
	the pilgrimage, found on his arrival scores of pilgrims at the gate,
	anxiously expecting his coming to pay the tax for them. Upon no
	occasion was such a boon refused.</p>

	<p>The sums drawn from this source were a mine of wealth to the
	Moslem governors of Palestine, imposed as the tax had been at a
	time when pilgrimages had become more numerous than ever. A
	strange idea had taken possession of the popular mind at the close
	of the tenth and commencement of the eleventh century. It was
	universally believed that the end of the world was at hand; that the
	thousand years of the Apocalypse were near completion, and that
	Jesus Christ would descend upon Jerusalem to judge mankind. All
	Christendom was in commotion. A panic terror seized upon the
	weak, the credulous, and the guilty, who in those days formed more
	than nineteen-twentieths of the population. Forsaking their homes,
	kindred, and occupation, they crowded to Jerusalem to await the
	coming of the Lord, lightened, as they imagined, of a load of sin
	by their weary pilgrimage. To increase the panic, the stars were
	observed to fall from heaven, earthquakes to shake the land, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>violent hurricanes to blow down the forests. All these, and more
	especially the meteoric phenomena, were looked upon as the forerunners
	of the approaching judgments. Not a meteor shot athwart
	the horizon that did not fill a district with alarm, and send away to
	Jerusalem a score of pilgrims, with staff in hand and wallet on their
	back, praying as they went for the remission of their sins. Men,
	women, and even children, trudged in droves to the holy city, in
	expectation of the day when the heavens would open, and the Son of
	God descend in his glory. This extraordinary delusion, while it augmented
	the numbers, increased also the hardships of the pilgrims.
	Beggars became so numerous on all the highways between the west
	of Europe and Constantinople, that the monks, the great almsgivers
	upon these occasions, would have brought starvation within sight of
	their own doors, if they had not economised their resources, and left
	the devotees to shift for themselves as they could. Hundreds of them
	were glad to subsist upon the berries that ripened by the road, who,
	before this great flux, might have shared the bread and flesh of the
	monasteries.</p>

	<p>But this was not the greatest of their difficulties. On their arrival
	in Jerusalem they found that a sterner race had obtained possession
	of the Holy Land. The caliphs of Bagdad had been succeeded by the
	harsh Turks of the race of Seljook, who looked upon the pilgrims
	with contempt and aversion. The Turks of the eleventh century
	were more ferocious and less scrupulous than the Saracens of the
	tenth. They were annoyed at the immense number of pilgrims who
	overran the country, and still more so because they shewed no intention
	of quitting it. The hourly expectation of the last judgment kept
	them waiting; and the Turks, apprehensive of being at last driven
	from the soil by the swarms that were still arriving, heaped up difficulties
	in their way. Persecution of every kind awaited them. They
	were plundered, and beaten with stripes, and kept in suspense for
	months at the gates of Jerusalem, unable to pay the golden bezant
	that was to procure them admission.</p>

	<p>When the first epidemic terror of the day of judgment began to
	subside, a few pilgrims ventured to return to Europe, their hearts big
	with indignation at the insults they had suffered. Every where as they
	passed they related to a sympathising auditory the wrongs of Christendom.
	Strange to say, even these recitals increased the mania for pilgrimage.
	The greater the dangers of the way, the fairer chance that sins
	of deep dye would be atoned for. Difficulty and suffering only heightened
	the merit, and fresh hordes issued from every town and village,
	to win favour in the sight of heaven by a visit to the holy sepulchre.
	Thus did things continue during the whole of the eleventh century.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>The train that was to explode so fearfully was now laid, and there
	wanted but the hand to apply the torch. At last the man appeared
	upon the scene. Like all who have ever achieved so great an end,
	Peter the Hermit was exactly suited to the age; neither behind it
	nor in advance of it; but acute enough to penetrate its mystery ere
	it was discovered by any other. Enthusiastic, chivalrous, bigoted,
	and, if not insane, not far removed from insanity, he was the very
	prototype of the time. True enthusiasm is always persevering and
	always eloquent, and these two qualities were united in no common
	degree in the person of this extraordinary preacher. He was a monk
	of Amiens, and ere he assumed the hood had served as a soldier. He
	is represented as having been ill favoured and low in stature, but
	with an eye of surpassing brightness and intelligence. Having been
	seized with the mania of the age, he visited Jerusalem, and remained
	there till his blood boiled to see the cruel persecution heaped upon
	the devotees. On his return home he shook the world by the eloquent
	story of their wrongs.</p>

	<p>Before entering into any further details of the marvellous results
	of his preaching, it will be advisable to cast a glance at the state of
	the mind of Europe, that we may understand all the better the causes
	of his success. First of all, there was the priesthood, which, exercising
	as it did the most conspicuous influence upon the fortunes of
	society, claims the largest share of attention. Religion was the ruling
	idea of that day, and the only civiliser capable of taming such wolves
	as then constituted the flock of the faithful. The clergy were all in
	all; and though they kept the popular mind in the most slavish subjection
	with regard to religious matters, they furnished it with the
	means of defence against all other oppression except their own. In
	the ecclesiastical ranks were concentrated all the true piety, all the
	learning, all the wisdom of the time; and, as a natural consequence,
	a great portion of power, which their very wisdom perpetually incited
	them to extend. The people knew nothing of kings and nobles, except
	in the way of injuries inflicted. The first ruled for, or more properly
	speaking against, the barons, and the barons only existed to
	brave the power of the kings, or to trample with their iron heels upon
	the neck of prostrate democracy. The latter had no friend but the
	clergy, and these, though they necessarily instilled the superstition
	from which they themselves were not exempt, yet taught the cheering
	doctrine that all men were equal in the sight of heaven. Thus,
	while Feudalism told them they had no rights in this world, Religion
	told them they had every right in the next. With this consolation
	they were for the time content, for political ideas had as yet taken
	no root. When the clergy, for other reasons, recommended the Crusade,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>the people joined in it with enthusiasm. The subject of Palestine
	filled all minds; the pilgrims’ tales of two centuries warmed every
	imagination; and when their friends, their guides, and their instructors
	preached a war so much in accordance with their own prejudices
	and modes of thinking, the enthusiasm rose into a frenzy.</p>

	<p>But while religion inspired the masses, another agent was at work
	upon the nobility. These were fierce and lawless; tainted with every
	vice, endowed with no virtue, and redeemed by one good quality
	alone, that of courage. The only religion they felt was the religion
	of fear. That and their overboiling turbulence alike combined to
	guide them to the Holy Land. Most of them had sins enough to
	answer for. They lived with their hand against every man, and
	with no law but their own passions. They set at defiance the secular
	power of the clergy; but their hearts quailed at the awful denunciations
	of the pulpit with regard to the life to come. War was the
	business and the delight of their existence; and when they were promised
	remission of all their sins upon the easy condition of following
	their favourite bent, it is not to be wondered at that they rushed with
	enthusiasm to the onslaught, and became as zealous in the service of
	the cross as the great majority of the people, who were swayed by
	more purely religious motives. Fanaticism and the love of battle
	alike impelled them to the war, while the kings and princes of Europe
	had still another motive for encouraging their zeal. Policy opened
	their eyes to the great advantages which would accrue to themselves
	by the absence of so many restless, intriguing, and bloodthirsty men,
	whose insolence it required more than the small power of royalty to
	restrain within due bounds. Thus every motive was favourable to
	the Crusades. Every class of society was alike incited to join or encourage
	the war: kings and the clergy by policy, the nobles by turbulence
	and the love of dominion, and the people by religious zeal and
	the concentrated enthusiasm of two centuries, skilfully directed by
	their only instructors.</p>

	<p>It was in Palestine itself that Peter the Hermit first conceived
	the grand idea of rousing the powers of Christendom to rescue the
	Christians of the East from the thraldom of the Mussulmans, and the
	sepulchre of Jesus from the rude hands of the infidel. The subject
	engrossed his whole mind. Even in the visions of the night he was
	full of it. One dream made such an impression upon him, that he
	devoutly believed the Saviour of the world himself appeared before
	him, and promised him aid and protection in his holy undertaking.
	If his zeal had ever wavered before, this was sufficient to fix it
	for ever.</p>

	<p>Peter, after he had performed all the penances and duties of his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>pilgrimage, demanded an interview with Simeon, the Patriarch of the
	Greek Church at Jerusalem. Though the latter was a heretic in
	Peter’s eyes, yet he was still a Christian, and felt as acutely as himself
	for the persecutions heaped by the Turks upon the followers of
	Jesus. The good prelate entered fully into his views, and, at his
	suggestion, wrote letters to the Pope, and to the most influential
	monarchs of Christendom, detailing the sorrows of the faithful, and
	urging them to take up arms in their defence. Peter was not a laggard
	in the work. Taking an affectionate farewell of the Patriarch,
	he returned in all haste to Italy. Pope Urban II. occupied the apostolic
	chair. It was at that time far from being an easy seat. His
	predecessor Gregory had bequeathed him a host of disputes with the
	Emperor Henry IV. of Germany, and he had converted Philip I. of
	France into an enemy by his strenuous opposition to an adulterous connexion
	formed by that monarch. So many dangers encompassed him,
	that the Vatican was no secure abode, and he had taken refuge in
	Apulia, under the protection of the renowned Robert Guiscard. Thither
	Peter appears to have followed him, though in what spot their
	meeting took place is not stated with any precision by ancient chroniclers
	or modern historians. Urban received him most kindly; read,
	with tears in his eyes, the epistle from the Patriarch Simeon, and listened
	to the eloquent story of the Hermit with an attention which
	shewed how deeply he sympathised with the woes of the Christian
	Church. Enthusiasm is contagious; and the Pope appears to have
	caught it instantly from one whose zeal was so unbounded. Giving
	the Hermit full powers, he sent him abroad to preach the holy war to
	all the nations and potentates of Christendom. The Hermit preached,
	and countless thousands answered to his call. France, Germany, and
	Italy started at his voice, and prepared for the deliverance of Zion.
	One of the early historians of the Crusade, who was himself an eye-witness
	of the rapture of Europe,<a href="#fn1" id="fnm1" title="Guibert de Nogent." class="fnmarker">1</a> describes the personal appearance
	of the Hermit at this time. He says, that there appeared to be something
	of divine in every thing which he said or did. The people so
	highly reverenced him, that they plucked hairs from the mane of his
	mule that they might keep them as relics. While preaching, he wore
	in general a woollen tunic, with a dark-coloured mantle, which fell
	down to his heels. His arms and feet were bare; and he ate neither
	flesh nor bread, supporting himself chiefly upon fish and wine. “He
	set out,” says the chronicler, “from whence I know not; but we
	saw him passing through the towns and villages, preaching every
	where, and the people surrounding him in crowds, loading him with
	offerings, and celebrating his sanctity with such great praises, that I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>never remember to have seen such honours bestowed upon any one.”
	Thus he went on, untired, inflexible, and full of devotion, communicating
	his own madness to his hearers, until Europe was stirred from
	its very depths.</p>

	<p>While the Hermit was appealing with such signal success to the
	people, the Pope appealed with as much success to those who were to
	become the chiefs and leaders of the expedition. His first step was to
	call a council at Placentia, in the autumn of the year 1095. Here, in
	the assembly of the clergy, the Pope debated the grand scheme, and
	gave audience to emissaries who had been sent from Constantinople
	by the Emperor of the East, to detail the progress made by the Turks
	in their design of establishing themselves in Europe. The clergy
	were of course unanimous in support of the Crusade; and the council
	separated, each individual member of it being empowered to preach it
	to his people.</p>

	<p>But Italy could not be expected to furnish all the aid required;
	and the Pope crossed the Alps to inspire the fierce and powerful
	nobility and chivalrous population of Gaul. His boldness in entering
	the territory, and placing himself in the power of his foe, King Philip
	of France, is not the least surprising feature of his mission. Some
	have imagined that cool policy alone actuated him; while others
	assert that it was mere zeal, as warm and as blind as that of Peter the
	Hermit. The latter opinion seems to be the true one. Society did
	not calculate the consequences of what it was doing. Every man
	seemed to act from impulse only; and the Pope, in throwing himself
	into the heart of France, acted as much from impulse as the thousands
	who responded to his call. A council was eventually summoned
	to meet him at Clermont, in Auvergne, to consider the state of the
	Church, reform abuses, and, above all, make preparations for the
	war. It was in the midst of an extremely cold winter, and the
	ground was covered with snow. During seven days the council sat
	with closed doors, while immense crowds from all parts of France
	flocked into the town, in expectation that the Pope himself would
	address the people. All the towns and villages for miles around were
	filled with the multitude; even the fields were encumbered with
	people, who, unable to procure lodging, pitched their tents under the
	trees and by the way-side. All the neighbourhood presented the
	appearance of a vast camp.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:241px;">

		<p class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL OF CLERMONT.</p>
	</div>

	<p>During the seven days’ deliberation, a sentence of excommunication
	was passed upon King Philip for adultery with Bertrade de
	Montfort, Countess of Anjou, and for disobedience to the supreme
	authority of the apostolic see. This bold step impressed the people
	with reverence for so stern a Church, which in the discharge of its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>duty shewed itself no respecter of persons. Their love and their
	fear were alike increased, and they were prepared to listen with more
	intense devotion to the preaching of so righteous and inflexible a
	pastor. The great square before the cathedral church of Clermont
	became every instant more densely crowded as the hour drew nigh
	when the Pope was to address the populace. Issuing from the church
	in his full canonicals, surrounded by his cardinals and bishops in all
	the splendour of Romish ecclesiastical costume, the Pope stood before
	the populace on a high scaffolding erected for the occasion, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>covered with scarlet cloth. A brilliant array of bishops and cardinals
	surrounded him; and among them, humbler in rank, but more important
	in the world’s eye, the Hermit Peter, dressed in his simple
	and austere habiliments. Historians differ as to whether or not Peter
	addressed the crowd, but as all agree that he was present, it seems
	reasonable to suppose that he spoke. But it was the oration of the
	Pope that was most important. As he lifted up his hands to ensure
	attention, every voice immediately became still. He began by detailing
	the miseries endured by their brethren in the Holy Land; how
	the plains of Palestine were desolated by the outrageous heathen, who
	with the sword and the firebrand carried wailing into the dwellings
	and flames into the possessions of the faithful; how Christian wives
	and daughters were defiled by pagan lust; how the altars of the
	true God were desecrated, and the relics of the saints trodden under
	foot. “You,” continued the eloquent pontiff (and Urban II. was
	one of the most eloquent men of the day), “you, who hear me, and
	who have received the true faith, and been endowed by God with
	power, and strength, and greatness of soul,—whose ancestors have
	been the prop of Christendom, and whose kings have put a barrier
	against the progress of the infidel,—I call upon you to wipe off these
	impurities from the face of the earth, and lift your oppressed fellow-Christians
	from the depths into which they have been trampled. The
	sepulchre of Christ is possessed by the heathen, the sacred places dishonoured
	by their vileness. Oh, brave knights and faithful people!
	offspring of invincible fathers! ye will not degenerate from your
	ancient renown. Ye will not be restrained from embarking in this
	great cause by the tender ties of wife or little ones, but will remember
	the words of the Saviour of the world himself, ‘Whosoever loves
	father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whosoever
	shall abandon for my name’s sake his house, or his brethren, or his
	sisters, or his father, or his mother, or his wife, or his children, or
	his lands, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.’”</p>

	<p>The warmth of the Pontiff communicated itself to the crowd, and
	the enthusiasm of the people broke out several times ere he concluded
	his address. He went on to portray, not only the spiritual but the
	temporal advantages that would accrue to those who took up arms
	in the service of the cross. Palestine was, he said, a land flowing
	with milk and honey, and precious in the sight of God, as the scene of
	the grand events which had saved mankind. That land, he promised,
	should be divided among them. Moreover, they should have full
	pardon for all their offences, either against God or man. “Go, then,”
	he added, “in expiation of your sins; and go assured, that after this
	world shall have passed away, imperishable glory shall be yours in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>the world which is to come.” The enthusiasm was no longer to be
	restrained, and loud shouts interrupted the speaker; the people exclaiming
	as if with one voice, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu le veult! Dieu le veult!</em>” With
	great presence of mind Urban took advantage of the outburst, and as
	soon as silence was obtained, continued: “Dear brethren, to-day is
	shewn forth in you that which the Lord has said by his Evangelist,
	‘When two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I
	be in the midst of them to bless them.’ If the Lord God had not
	been in your souls, you would not all have pronounced the same
	words; or rather God himself pronounced them by your lips, for it
	was he that put them in your hearts. Be they, then, your war-cry
	in the combat, for those words came forth from God. Let the army
	of the Lord, when it rushes upon his enemies, shout but that one cry,
	‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu le veult! Dieu le veult!</em>’ Let whoever is inclined to devote
	himself to this holy cause make it a solemn engagement, and bear the
	cross of the Lord either on his breast or his brow till he set out; and
	let him who is ready to begin his march place the holy emblem on
	his shoulders, in memory of that precept of our Saviour, ‘He who
	does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.’”</p>

	<p>The news of this council spread to the remotest parts of Europe
	in an incredibly short space of time. Long before the fleetest horseman
	could have brought the intelligence, it was known by the people
	in distant provinces; a fact which was considered as nothing less than
	supernatural. But the subject was in every body’s mouth, and the
	minds of men were prepared for the result. The enthusiastic merely
	asserted what they wished, and the event tallied with their prediction.
	This was, however, quite enough in those days for a miracle, and as
	a miracle every one regarded it.</p>

	<p>For several months after the Council of Clermont, France and Germany
	presented a singular spectacle. The pious, the fanatic, the needy,
	the dissolute, the young and the old, even women and children, and
	the halt and lame, enrolled themselves by hundreds. In every village
	the clergy were busied in keeping up the excitement, promising eternal
	rewards to those who assumed the red cross, and fulminating the
	most awful denunciations against all the worldly-minded who refused
	or even hesitated. Every debtor who joined the Crusade was freed
	by the papal edict from the claims of his creditors; outlaws of every
	grade were made equal with the honest upon the same conditions.
	The property of those who went was placed under the protection of
	the Church, and St. Paul and St. Peter themselves were believed to
	descend from their high abode, to watch over the chattels of the
	absent pilgrims. Signs and portents were seen in the air, to increase
	the fervour of the multitude. An aurora-borealis of unusual brilliancy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>appeared, and thousands of the Crusaders came out to gaze upon it,
	prostrating themselves upon the earth in adoration. It was thought
	to be a sure prognostic of the interposition of the Most High; and a
	representation of his armies fighting with and overthrowing the infidels.
	Reports of wonders were every where rife. A monk had seen
	two gigantic warriors on horseback, the one representing a Christian
	and the other a Turk, fighting in the sky with flaming swords, the
	Christian of course overcoming the Paynim. Myriads of stars were
	said to have fallen from heaven, each representing the fall of a Pagan
	foe. It was believed at the same time that the Emperor Charlemagne
	would rise from the grave, and lead on to victory the embattled
	armies of the Lord. A singular feature of the popular madness was
	the enthusiasm of the women. Every where they encouraged their
	lovers and husbands to forsake all things for the holy war. Many of
	them burned the sign of the cross upon their breasts and arms, and
	coloured the wound with a red dye, as a lasting memorial of their
	zeal. Others, still more zealous, impressed the mark by the same
	means upon the tender limbs of young children and infants at the
	breast.</p>

	<p>Guibert de Nogent tells of a monk who made a large incision upon
	his forehead in the form of a cross, which he coloured with some
	powerful ingredient, telling the people that an angel had done it
	when he was asleep. This monk appears to have been more of a
	rogue than a fool, for he contrived to fare more sumptuously than
	any of his brother pilgrims, upon the strength of his sanctity. The
	Crusaders every where gave him presents of food and money, and he
	became quite fat ere he arrived at Jerusalem, notwithstanding the
	fatigues of the way. If he had acknowledged in the first place that
	he had made the wound himself, he would not have been thought
	more holy than his fellows; but the story of the angel was a clincher.</p>

	<p>All those who had property of any description rushed to the mart
	to change it into hard cash. Lands and houses could be had for a
	quarter of their value, while arms and accoutrements of war rose in
	the same proportion. Corn, which had been excessively dear in anticipation
	of a year of scarcity, suddenly became plentiful; and such
	was the diminution in the value of provisions, that seven sheep were
	sold for five <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deniers</em>.<a href="#fn2" id="fnm2" title="Guibert de Nogent." class="fnmarker">2</a> The nobles mortgaged their estates for mere
	trifles to Jews and unbelievers, or conferred charters of immunity upon
	the towns and communes within their fiefs, for sums which, a few
	years previously, they would have rejected with disdain. The farmer
	endeavoured to sell his plough, and the artisan his tools, to purchase
	a sword for the deliverance of Jerusalem. Women disposed of their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>trinkets for the same purpose. During the spring and summer of
	this year (1096) the roads teemed with crusaders, all hastening to the
	towns and villages appointed as the rendezvous of the district. Some
	were on horseback, some in carts, and some came down the rivers in
	boats and rafts, bringing their wives and children, all eager to go to
	Jerusalem. Very few knew where Jerusalem was. Some thought it
	fifty thousand miles away, and others imagined that it was but a
	month’s journey; while at sight of every town or castle the children
	exclaimed, “Is that Jerusalem? Is that the city?”<a href="#fn3" id="fnm3" title="Guibert de Nogent." class="fnmarker">3</a> Parties of
	knights and nobles might be seen travelling eastward, and amusing
	themselves as they went with the knightly diversion of hawking, to
	lighten the fatigues of the way.</p>

	<p>Guibert de Nogent, who did not write from hearsay, but from
	actual observation, says the enthusiasm was so contagious, that when
	any one heard the orders of the Pontiff, he went instantly to solicit
	his neighbours and friends to join with him in “the way of God,” for
	so they called the proposed expedition. The Counts Palatine were
	full of the desire to undertake the journey, and all the inferior knights
	were animated with the same zeal. Even the poor caught the flame
	so ardently, that no one paused to think of the inadequacy of his
	means, or to consider whether he ought to yield up his farm, his vineyard,
	or his fields. Each one set about selling his property at as low
	a price as if he had been held in some horrible captivity, and sought
	to pay his ransom without loss of time. Those who had not determined
	upon the journey joked and laughed at those who were thus
	disposing of their goods at such ruinous prices, prophesying that the
	expedition would be miserable and their return worse. But they held
	this language only for a day; the next they were suddenly seized with
	the same frenzy as the rest. Those who had been loudest in their
	jeers gave up all their property for a few crowns, and set out with
	those they had so laughed at a few hours before. In most cases the
	laugh was turned against them; for when it became known that a
	man was hesitating, his more zealous neighbours sent him a present
	of a knitting-needle or a distaff, to shew their contempt of him.
	There was no resisting this; so that the fear of ridicule contributed
	its fair contingent to the armies of the Lord.</p>

	<p>Another effect of the Crusade was, the religious obedience with
	which it inspired the people and the nobility for that singular institution
	“The Truce of God.” At the commencement of the eleventh
	century, the clergy of France, sympathising for the woes of the people,
	but unable to diminish them, by repressing the rapacity and insolence
	of the feudal chiefs, endeavoured to promote universal good-will by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>the promulgation of the famous “Peace of God.” All who conformed
	to it bound themselves by oath not to take revenge for any injury,
	not to enjoy the fruits of property usurped from others, nor to use
	deadly weapons; in reward of which they would receive remission of
	all their sins. However benevolent the intention of this “Peace,” it
	led to nothing but perjury, and violence reigned as uncontrolled as
	before. In the year 1041, another attempt was made to soften the
	angry passions of the semi-barbarous chiefs, and the “Truce of God”
	was solemnly proclaimed. The <em>truce</em> lasted from the Wednesday evening
	to the Monday morning of every week, in which interval it was
	strictly forbidden to recur to violence on any pretext, or to seek
	revenge for any injury. It was impossible to civilise men by these
	means. Few even promised to become peaceable for so unconscionable
	a period as five days a-week; or if they did, they made ample
	amends on the two days left open to them. The truce was afterwards
	shortened from the Saturday evening to the Monday morning; but
	little or no diminution of violence and bloodshed was the consequence.
	At the Council of Clermont, Urban II. again solemnly proclaimed the
	truce. So strong was the religious feeling, that every one hastened
	to obey. All minor passions disappeared before the grand passion of
	crusading. The feudal chief ceased to oppress, the robber to plunder,
	the people to complain; but one idea was in all hearts, and there
	seemed to be no room for any other.</p>

	<p>The encampments of these heterogeneous multitudes offered a singular
	aspect. Those vassals who ranged themselves under the banners
	of their lord erected tents around his castle; while those who undertook
	the war on their own account constructed booths and huts in
	the neighbourhood of the towns or villages, preparatory to their joining
	some popular leader of the expedition. The meadows of France
	were covered with tents. As the belligerents were to have remission
	of all their sins on their arrival in Palestine, hundreds of them gave
	themselves up to the most unbounded licentiousness. The courtesan,
	with the red cross upon her shoulders, plied her shameless trade with
	sensual pilgrims without scruple on either side; the lover of good cheer
	gave loose rein to his appetite, and drunkenness and debauchery
	flourished. Their zeal in the service of the Lord was to wipe out all
	faults and follies, and they had the same surety of salvation as the
	rigid anchorite. This reasoning had charms for the ignorant, and
	the sounds of lewd revelry and the voice of prayer rose at the same
	instant from the camp.</p>

	<p>It is now time to speak of the leaders of the expedition. Great
	multitudes ranged themselves under the command of Peter the Hermit,
	whom, as the originator, they considered the most appropriate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>leader of the war. Others joined the banner of a bold adventurer,
	whom history has dignified with no other name than that of Gautier
	sans Avoir, or Walter the Pennyless, but who is represented as having
	been of noble family, and well skilled in the art of war. A third
	multitude from Germany flocked around the standard of a monk
	named Gottschalk, of whom nothing is known except that he was a
	fanatic of the deepest dye. All these bands, which together are said
	to have amounted to three hundred thousand men, women, and children,
	were composed of the vilest rascality of Europe. Without discipline,
	principle, or true courage, they rushed through the nations like
	a pestilence, spreading terror and death wherever they went. The
	first multitude that set forth was led by Walter the Pennyless early
	in the spring of 1096, within a very few months after the Council of
	Clermont. Each man of that irregular host aspired to be his own
	master. Like their nominal leader, each was poor to penury, and
	trusted for subsistence on his journey to the chances of the road.
	Rolling through Germany like a tide, they entered Hungary, where,
	at first, they were received with some degree of kindness by the people.
	The latter had not yet caught sufficient of the fire of enthusiasm to
	join the Crusade themselves, but were willing enough to forward the
	cause by aiding those embarked in it. Unfortunately this good understanding
	did not last long. The swarm were not contented with food
	for their necessities, but craved for luxuries also. They attacked and
	plundered the dwellings of the country people, and thought nothing
	of murder where resistance was offered. On their arrival before
	Semlin, the outraged Hungarians collected in large numbers, and,
	attacking the rear of the crusading host, slew a great many of the
	stragglers, and, taking away their arms and crosses, affixed them as
	trophies to the walls of the city. Walter appears to have been in no
	mood or condition to make reprisals; for his army, destructive as a
	plague of locusts when plunder urged them on, were useless against
	any regular attack from a determined enemy. Their rear continued
	to be thus harassed by the wrathful Hungarians until they were fairly
	out of their territory. On his entrance into Bulgaria, Walter met
	with no better fate. The cities and towns refused to let him pass;
	the villages denied him provisions; and the citizens and country
	people uniting, slaughtered his followers by hundreds. The progress
	of the army was more like a retreat than an advance; but as it was
	impossible to stand still, Walter continued his course till he arrived
	at Constantinople with a force which famine and the sword had diminished
	to one-third of its original number.</p>

	<p>The greater multitude, led by the enthusiastic Hermit, followed
	close upon his heels, with a bulky train of baggage, and women and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>children sufficient to form a host of themselves. If it were possible
	to find a rabble more vile than the army of Walter the Pennyless, it
	was that led by Peter the Hermit. Being better provided with means,
	they were not reduced to the necessity of pillage in their progress
	through Hungary; and had they taken any other route than that
	which led through Semlin, might perhaps have traversed the country
	without molestation. On their arrival before that city, their fury
	was raised at seeing the arms and red crosses of their predecessors
	hanging as trophies over the gates. Their pent-up ferocity exploded
	at the sight. The city was tumultuously attacked, and the besiegers
	entering, not by dint of bravery, but of superior numbers, it was
	given up to all the horrors which follow when victory, brutality, and
	licentiousness are linked together. Every evil passion was allowed
	to revel with impunity, and revenge, lust, and avarice,—each had its
	hundreds of victims in unhappy Semlin. Any maniac can kindle a
	conflagration, but it may require many wise men to put it out. Peter
	the Hermit had blown the popular fury into a flame, but to cool it
	again was beyond his power. His followers rioted unrestrained, until
	the fear of retaliation warned them to desist. When the king of
	Hungary was informed of the disasters of Semlin, he marched with a
	sufficient force to chastise the Hermit, who, at the news, broke up
	his camp and retreated towards the Morava, a broad and rapid stream
	that joins the Danube a few miles to the eastward of Belgrade. Here
	a party of indignant Bulgarians awaited him, and so harassed him, as
	to make the passage of the river a task both of difficulty and danger.
	Great numbers of his infatuated followers perished in the waters, and
	many fell under the swords of the Bulgarians. The ancient chronicles
	do not mention the amount of the Hermit’s loss at this passage,
	but represent it in general terms as very great.</p>

	<p>At Nissa, the Duke of Bulgaria fortified himself, in fear of an
	assault; but Peter, having learned a little wisdom from experience,
	thought it best to avoid hostilities. He passed three nights in quietness
	under the walls, and the duke, not wishing to exasperate unnecessarily
	so fierce and rapacious a host, allowed the townspeople to
	supply them with provisions. Peter took his departure peaceably on
	the following morning; but some German vagabonds, falling behind
	the main body of the army, set fire to the mills and house of a Bulgarian,
	with whom, it appears, they had had some dispute on the
	previous evening. The citizens of Nissa, who had throughout mistrusted
	the Crusaders, and were prepared for the worst, sallied out
	immediately, and took signal vengeance. The spoilers were cut to
	pieces, and the townspeople pursuing the Hermit, captured all the
	women and children who had lagged in the rear, and a great quantity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>of baggage. Peter hereupon turned round and marched back to
	Nissa, to demand explanation of the Duke of Bulgaria. The latter
	fairly stated the provocation given, and the Hermit could urge nothing
	in palliation of so gross an outrage. A negotiation was entered
	into, which promised to be successful, and the Bulgarians were about
	to deliver up the women and children, when a party of undisciplined
	Crusaders, acting solely upon their own suggestion, endeavoured to
	scale the walls and seize upon the town. Peter in vain exerted his
	authority; the confusion became general, and after a short but desperate
	battle, the Crusaders threw down their arms, and fled in all
	directions. Their vast host was completely routed, the slaughter
	being so great among them, as to be counted, not by hundreds, but
	by thousands.</p>

	<p>It is said that the Hermit fled from this fatal field to a forest a
	few miles from Nissa, abandoned by every human creature. It would
	be curious to know whether, after so dire a reverse,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i16">“His enpierced breast</p>
		<p>Sharp sorrow did in thousand pieces rive,”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">or whether his fiery zeal still rose superior to calamity, and pictured
	the eventual triumph of his cause. He, so lately the leader of a hundred
	thousand men, was now a solitary skulker in the forests, liable
	at every instant to be discovered by some pursuing Bulgarian, and
	cut off in mid career. Chance at last brought him within sight of
	an eminence, where two or three of his bravest knights had collected
	five hundred of the stragglers. These gladly received the Hermit,
	and a consultation having taken place, it was resolved to gather together
	the scattered remnants of the army. Fires were lighted on the
	hill, and scouts sent out in all directions for the fugitives. Horns
	were sounded at intervals, to make known that friends were near,
	and before nightfall the Hermit saw himself at the head of seven
	thousand men. During the succeeding day, he was joined by twenty
	thousand more, and with this miserable remnant of his force, he pursued
	his route towards Constantinople. The bones of the rest mouldered
	in the forests of Bulgaria.</p>

	<p>On his arrival at Constantinople, where he found Walter the
	Pennyless awaiting him, he was hospitably received by the Emperor
	Alexius. It might have been expected that the sad reverses they
	had undergone would have taught his followers common prudence;
	but, unhappily for them, their turbulence and love of plunder was
	not to be restrained. Although they were surrounded by friends, by
	whom all their wants were liberally supplied, they could not refrain
	from rapine. In vain the Hermit exhorted them to tranquillity; he
	possessed no more power over them, in subduing their passions, than
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>the obscurest soldier of the host. They set fire to several public
	buildings in Constantinople out of pure mischief, and stripped the
	lead from the roofs of the churches, which they afterwards sold for
	old metal in the purlieus of the city. From this time may be dated
	the aversion which the Emperor Alexius entertained for the Crusaders,
	and which was afterwards manifested in all his actions, even when he
	had to deal with the chivalrous and more honourable armies which
	arrived after the Hermit. He seems to have imagined that the Turks
	themselves were enemies less formidable to his power than these outpourings
	of the refuse of Europe: he soon found a pretext to hurry
	them into Asia Minor. Peter crossed the Bosphorus with Walter,
	but the excesses of his followers were such, that, despairing of accomplishing
	any good end by remaining at their head, he left them to
	themselves, and returned to Constantinople, on the pretext of making
	arrangements with the government of Alexius for a proper supply of
	provisions. The Crusaders, forgetting that they were in the enemy’s
	country, and that union, above all things, was desirable, gave themselves
	up to dissensions. Violent disputes arose between the Lombards
	and Normans commanded by Walter the Pennyless, and the
	Franks and Germans led out by Peter. The latter separated themselves
	from the former, and, choosing for their leader one Reinaldo,
	or Reinhold, marched forward, and took possession of the fortress of
	Exorogorgon. The Sultan Solimaun was on the alert, with a superior
	force. A party of Crusaders, which had been detached from the fort,
	and stationed at a little distance as an ambuscade, were surprised
	and cut to pieces, and Exorogorgon invested on all sides. The siege
	was protracted for eight days, during which the Christians suffered
	the most acute agony from the want of water. It is hard to say how
	long the hope of succour or the energy of despair would have enabled
	them to hold out: their treacherous leader cut the matter short by
	renouncing the Christian faith, and delivering up the fort into the
	hands of the sultan. He was followed by two or three of his officers;
	all the rest, refusing to become Mahometans, were ruthlessly put to
	the sword. Thus perished the last wretched remnant of the vast
	multitude which had traversed Europe with Peter the Hermit.</p>

	<p>Walter the Pennyless and his multitude met as miserable a fate.
	On the news of the disasters of Exorogorgon, they demanded to be
	led instantly against the Turks. Walter, who only wanted good soldiers
	to have made a good general, was cooler of head, and saw all
	the dangers of such a step. His force was wholly insufficient to make
	any decisive movement in a country where the enemy was so much
	superior, and where, in case of defeat, he had no secure position to
	fall back upon; and he therefore expressed his opinion against
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>advancing until the arrival of reinforcements. This prudent counsel
	found no favour: the army loudly expressed their dissatisfaction at
	their chief, and prepared to march forward without him. Upon this,
	the brave Walter put himself at their head, and rushed to destruction.
	Proceeding towards Nice, the modern Isnik, he was intercepted
	by the army of the sultan: a fierce battle ensued, in which
	the Turks made fearful havoc; out of twenty-five thousand Christians,
	twenty-two thousand were slain, and among them Gautier himself,
	who fell pierced by seven mortal wounds. The remaining three
	thousand retreated upon Civitot, where they entrenched themselves.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Disgusted as was Peter the Hermit at the excesses of the multitude,
	who, at his call, had forsaken Europe, his heart was moved
	with grief and pity at their misfortunes. All his former zeal revived:
	casting himself at the feet of the Emperor Alexius, he implored him,
	with tears in his eyes, to send relief to the few survivors at Civitot.
	The emperor consented, and a force was sent, which arrived just in
	time to save them from destruction. The Turks had beleaguered the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>place, and the Crusaders were reduced to the last extremity. Negotiations
	were entered into, and the last three thousand were conducted
	in safety to Constantinople. Alexius had suffered too much
	by their former excesses to be very desirous of retaining them in his
	capital: he therefore caused them all to be disarmed, and, furnishing
	each with a sum of money, he sent them back to their own
	country.</p>

	<p>While these events were taking place, fresh hordes were issuing
	from the woods and wilds of Germany, all bent for the Holy Land.
	They were commanded by a fanatical priest, named Gottschalk, who,
	like Gautier and Peter the Hermit, took his way through Hungary.
	History is extremely meagre in her details of the conduct and fate
	of this host, which amounted to at least one hundred thousand men.
	Robbery and murder seem to have journeyed with them, and the
	poor Hungarians were rendered almost desperate by their numbers
	and rapacity. Karloman, the king of the country, made a bold
	effort to get rid of them; for the resentment of his people had arrived
	at such a height, that nothing short of the total extermination
	of the Crusaders would satisfy them. Gottschalk had to pay
	the penalty, not only for the ravages of his own bands, but for those
	of the swarms that had come before him. He and his army were induced,
	by some means or other, to lay down their arms: the savage
	Hungarians, seeing them thus defenceless, set upon them, and slaughtered
	them in great numbers. How many escaped their arrows we
	are not informed; but not one of them reached Palestine.</p>

	<p>Other swarms, under nameless leaders, issued from Germany and
	France, more brutal and more frantic than any that had preceded
	them. Their fanaticism surpassed by far the wildest freaks of the
	followers of the Hermit. In bands, varying in numbers from one to
	five thousand, they traversed the country in all directions, bent upon
	plunder and massacre. They wore the symbol of the Crusade upon
	their shoulders, but inveighed against the folly of proceeding to the
	Holy Land to destroy the Turks, while they left behind them so many
	Jews, the still more inveterate enemies of Christ. They swore fierce
	vengeance against this unhappy race, and murdered all the Hebrews
	they could lay their hands on, first subjecting them to the most horrible
	mutilation. According to the testimony of Albert Aquensis, they
	lived among each other in the most shameless profligacy, and their
	vice was only exceeded by their superstition. Whenever they were
	in search of Jews, they were preceded by a goose and goat, which
	they believed to be holy, and animated with divine power to discover
	the retreats of the unbelievers. In Germany alone they slaughtered
	more than a thousand Jews, notwithstanding all the efforts of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>clergy to save them. So dreadful was the cruelty of their tormentors,
	that great numbers of Jews committed self-destruction to avoid falling
	into their hands.</p>

	<p>Again it fell to the lot of the Hungarians to deliver Europe from
	these pests. When there were no more Jews to murder, the bands
	collected in one body, and took the old route to the Holy Land, a
	route stained with the blood of three hundred thousand who had gone
	before, and destined also to receive theirs. The number of these
	swarms has never been stated; but so many of them perished in Hungary,
	that contemporary writers, despairing of giving any adequate
	idea of their multitudes, state that the fields were actually heaped
	with their corpses, and that for miles in its course the waters of the
	Danube were dyed with their blood. It was at Mersburg, on the
	Danube, that the greatest slaughter took place,—a slaughter so great
	as to amount almost to extermination. The Hungarians for a while
	disputed the passage of the river, but the Crusaders forced their way
	across, and attacking the city with the blind courage of madness, succeeded
	in making a breach in the walls. At this moment of victory
	an unaccountable fear came over them. Throwing down their arms,
	they fled panic-stricken, no one knew why, and no one knew whither.
	The Hungarians followed, sword in hand, and cut them down without
	remorse, and in such numbers, that the stream of the Danube is said
	to have been choked up by their unburied bodies.</p>

	<p>This was the worst paroxysm of the madness of Europe; and this
	passed, her chivalry stepped upon the scene. Men of cool heads,
	mature plans, and invincible courage stood forward to lead and direct
	the grand movement of Europe upon Asia. It is upon these men
	that romance has lavished her most admiring epithets, leaving to the
	condemnation of history the vileness and brutality of those who went
	before. Of these leaders the most distinguished were Godfrey of
	Bouillon duke of Lorraine, and Raymond count of Toulouse. Four
	other chiefs of the royal blood of Europe also assumed the cross, and
	led each his army to the Holy Land; Hugh count of Vermandois,
	brother of the king of France; Robert duke of Normandy, the elder
	brother of William Rufus; Robert count of Flanders, and Bohemund
	prince of Tarentum, eldest son of the celebrated Robert Guiscard.
	These men were all tinged with the fanaticism of the age, but none of
	them acted entirely from religious motives. They were neither utterly
	reckless like Gautier sans Avoir, crazy like Peter the Hermit, nor
	brutal like Gottschalk the Monk, but possessed each of these qualities
	in a milder form; their valour being tempered by caution, their religious
	zeal by worldly views, and their ferocity by the spirit of chivalry.
	They saw whither led the torrent of the public will; and it being
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>neither their wish nor their interest to stem it, they allowed themselves to
	be carried with it, in the hope that it would lead them at last to a haven
	of aggrandisement. Around them congregated many minor chiefs,
	the flower of the nobility of France and Italy, with some few from
	Germany, England, and Spain. It was wisely conjectured that armies
	so numerous would find a difficulty in procuring provisions if they
	all journeyed by the same road. They therefore resolved to separate;
	Godfrey de Bouillon proceeding through Hungary and Bulgaria,
	the Count of Toulouse through Lombardy and Dalmatia, and the
	other leaders through Apulia to Constantinople, where the several
	divisions were to reunite. The forces under these leaders have been
	variously estimated. The Princess Anna Comnena talks of them as
	having been as numerous as the sands on the sea-shore, or the stars in
	the firmament. Fulcher of Chartres is more satisfactory, and exaggerates
	less magnificently, when he states, that all the divisions,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>when they had sat down before Nice in Bithynia, amounted to one
	hundred thousand horsemen, and six hundred thousand men on foot,
	exclusive of the priests, women, and children. Gibbon is of opinion
	that this amount is exaggerated; but thinks the actual numbers did
	not fall very far short of the calculation. The Princess Anna afterwards
	gives the number of those under Godfrey of Bouillon as eighty
	thousand foot and horse; and supposing that each of the other chiefs
	led an army as numerous, the total would be near half a million.
	This must be over rather than under the mark, as the army of Godfrey
	of Bouillon was confessedly the largest when it set out, and suffered
	less by the way than any other.</p>

		<p class="caption">GODFREY DE BOUILLON.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The Count of Vermandois was the first who set foot on the Grecian
	territory. On his arrival at Durazzo he was received with every mark
	of respect and courtesy by the agents of the emperor, and his followers
	were abundantly supplied with provisions. Suddenly, however, and
	without cause assigned, the count was arrested by order of the Emperor
	Alexius, and conveyed a close prisoner to Constantinople. Various
	motives have been assigned by different authors as having induced
	the emperor to this treacherous and imprudent proceeding. By every
	writer he has been condemned for so flagrant a breach of hospitality and
	justice. The most probable reason for his conduct appears to be that
	suggested by Guibert of Nogent, who states that Alexius, fearful of the
	designs of the Crusaders upon his throne, resorted to this extremity in
	order afterwards to force the count to take the oath of allegiance to him,
	as the price of his liberation. The example of a prince so eminent as
	the brother of the king of France, would, he thought, be readily followed
	by the other chiefs of the Crusade. In the result he was wofully
	disappointed, as every man deserves to be who commits positive
	evil that doubtful good may ensue. But this line of policy accorded
	well enough with the narrowmindedness of the emperor, who, in the
	enervating atmosphere of his highly civilised and luxurious court,
	dreaded the influx of the hardy and ambitious warriors of the West,
	and strove to nibble away by unworthy means the power which he
	had not energy enough to confront. If danger to himself had existed
	from the residence of the chiefs in his dominions, he might easily
	have averted it, by the simple means of placing himself at the head
	of the European movement, and directing its energies to their avowed
	object, the conquest of the Holy Land. But the emperor, instead
	of being, as he might have been, the lord and leader of the Crusades,
	which he had himself aided in no inconsiderable degree to suscitate
	by his embassies to the Pope, became the slave of men who hated and
	despised him. No doubt the barbarous excesses of the followers of
	Gautier and Peter the Hermit made him look upon the whole body
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>of them with disgust, but it was the disgust of a little mind, which
	is glad of any excuse to palliate or justify its own irresolution and
	love of ease.</p>

	<p>Godfrey of Bouillon traversed Hungary in the most quiet and
	orderly manner. On his arrival at Mersburg he found the country
	strewed with the mangled corpses of the Jew-killers, and demanded
	of the king of Hungary for what reason his people had set upon
	them. The latter detailed the atrocities they had committed, and
	made it so evident to Godfrey that the Hungarians had only acted in
	self-defence, that the high-minded leader declared himself satisfied,
	and passed on without giving or receiving molestation. On his arrival
	at Philippopoli he was informed for the first time of the imprisonment
	of the count of Vermandois. He immediately sent messengers
	to the emperor, demanding the count’s release, and threatening,
	in case of refusal, to lay waste the country with fire and sword. After
	waiting a day at Philippopoli, he marched on to Adrianople, where
	he was met by his messengers returning with the emperor’s refusal.
	Godfrey, the bravest and most determined of the leaders of the Crusade,
	was not a man to swerve from his word, and the country was
	given up to pillage. Alexius here committed another blunder. No
	sooner did he learn from dire experience that the Crusader was not an
	utterer of idle threats, than he consented to the release of the prisoner.
	As he had been unjust in the first instance, he became cowardly in
	the second, and taught his enemies (for so the Crusaders were forced
	to consider themselves) a lesson which they took care to remember to
	his cost, that they could hope nothing from his sense of justice, but
	every thing from his fears. Godfrey remained encamped for several
	weeks in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, to the great annoyance
	of Alexius, who sought by every means to extort from him the
	homage he had extorted from Vermandois. Sometimes he acted as
	if at open and declared war with the Crusaders, and sent his troops
	against them. Sometimes he refused to supply them with food, and
	ordered the markets to be shut against them, while at other times he
	was all for peace and good-will, and sent costly presents to Godfrey.
	The honest, straightforward Crusader was at last so wearied by his
	false kindness, and so pestered by his attacks, that, allowing his indignation
	to get the better of his judgment, he gave up the country
	around Constantinople to be plundered by his soldiers. For six days
	the flames of the farm-houses around struck terror into the heart of
	Alexius; but, as Godfrey anticipated, they convinced him of his error.
	Fearing that Constantinople itself would be the next object of attack,
	he sent messengers to demand an interview with Godfrey, offering at
	the same time to leave his son as a hostage for his good faith.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>Godfrey agreed to meet him; and, whether to put an end to these useless
	dissensions, or for some other unexplained reason, he rendered
	homage to Alexius as his liege lord. He was thereupon loaded with
	honours, and, according to a singular custom of that age, underwent
	the ceremony of the “adoption of honour” as son to the emperor.
	Godfrey and his brother Baudouin de Bouillon conducted themselves
	with proper courtesy on this occasion, but were not able to restrain
	the insolence of their followers, who did not conceive themselves
	bound to keep any terms with a man so insincere as he had shewn
	himself. One barbarous chieftain, Count Robert of Paris, carried his
	insolence so far as to seat himself upon the throne; an insult which
	Alexius merely resented with a sneer, but which did not induce him
	to look with less mistrust upon the hordes that were still advancing.</p>

	<p>It is impossible, notwithstanding his treachery, to avoid feeling
	some compassion for the emperor, whose life at this time was rendered
	one long scene of misery by the presumption of the Crusaders,
	and his not altogether groundless fears of the evil they might inflict
	upon him, should any untoward circumstance force the current of
	their ambition to the conquest of his empire. His daughter Anna
	Comnena feelingly deplores his state of life at this time, and a learned
	German<a href="#fn4" id="fnm4" title="M. Wilken’s..." class="fnmarker">4</a>, in a recent work, describes it, on the authority of the princess,
	in the following manner:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“To avoid all occasion of offence to the Crusaders, Alexius complied
		with all their whims and their (on many occasions) unreasonable
		demands, even at the expense of great bodily exertion, at a time when
		he was suffering severely under the gout, which eventually brought
		him to his grave. No Crusader who desired an interview with him
		was refused access; he listened with the utmost patience to the long-winded
		harangues which their loquacity or zeal continually wearied
		him with; he endured, without expressing any impatience, the unbecoming
		and haughty language which they permitted themselves to
		employ towards him, and severely reprimanded his officers when they
		undertook to defend the dignity of the imperial station from these
		rude assaults, for he trembled with apprehension at the slightest disputes,
		lest they might become the occasion of greater evil. Though
		the counts often appeared before him with trains altogether unsuitable
		to their dignity and to his—sometimes with an entire troop,
		which completely filled the royal apartment—the emperor held his
		peace. He listened to them at all hours; he often seated himself on
		his throne at day-break to attend to their wishes and requests, and
		the evening twilight saw him still in the same place. Very frequently
		he could not snatch time to refresh himself with meat and drink.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>During many nights he could not obtain any repose, and was obliged
		to indulge in an unrefreshing sleep upon his throne, with his head
		resting on his hands. Even this slumber was continually disturbed
		by the appearance and harangues of some newly-arrived rude knights.
		When all the courtiers, wearied out by the efforts of the day and by
		night-watching, could no longer keep themselves on their feet, and
		sank down exhausted—some upon benches and others on the floor—Alexius
		still rallied his strength to listen with seeming attention to
		the wearisome chatter of the Latins, that they might have no occasion
		or pretext for discontent. In such a state of fear and anxiety, how
		could Alexius comport himself with dignity and like an emperor?”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Alexius, however, had himself to blame, in a great measure, for
	the indignities he suffered: owing to his insincerity, the Crusaders
	mistrusted him so much, that it became at last a common saying,
	that the Turks and Saracens were not such inveterate foes to the
	Western or Latin Christians as the Emperor Alexius and the Greeks<a href="#fn5" id="fnm5" title="Wilken." class="fnmarker">5</a>.
	It would be needless in this sketch, which does not profess to be so
	much a history of the Crusades, as of the madness of Europe, from
	which they sprang, to detail the various acts of bribery and intimidation,
	cajolery and hostility, by which Alexius contrived to make each
	of the leaders in succession, as they arrived, take the oath of allegiance
	to him as their suzerain. One way or another he exacted from
	each the barren homage on which he had set his heart, and they were
	then allowed to proceed into Asia Minor. One only, Raymond de
	St. Gilles count of Toulouse, obstinately refused the homage.</p>



	<p>Their residence in Constantinople was productive of no good to
	the armies of the cross. Bickerings and contentions on the one
	hand, and the influence of a depraved and luxurious court on the
	other, destroyed the elasticity of their spirits, and cooled the first
	ardour of their enthusiasm. At one time the army of the Count of
	Toulouse was on the point of disbanding itself; and, had not their
	leader energetically removed them across the Bosphorus, this would
	have been the result. Once in Asia, their spirits in some degree
	revived, and the presence of danger and difficulty nerved them to
	the work they had undertaken. The first operation of the war was
	the siege of Nice, to gain possession of which all their efforts were
	directed.</p>

	<p>Godfrey of Bouillon and the Count of Vermandois were joined
	under its walls by each host in succession as it left Constantinople.
	Among the celebrated Crusaders who fought at this siege we find,
	besides the leaders already mentioned, the brave and generous
	Tancred, whose name and fame have been immortalised in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerusalemme Liberata</cite>, the valorous Bishop of Puy, Baldwin, afterwards
	king of Jerusalem, and Peter the Hermit, now an almost solitary
	soldier, shorn of all the power and influence he had formerly
	possessed. Kilij Aslaun the sultan of Roum and chief of the Seljukian
	Turks, whose deeds, surrounded by the false halo of romance,
	are familiar to the readers of Tasso, under the name of Soliman,
	marched to defend this city, but was defeated after several obstinate
	engagements, in which the Christians shewed a degree of heroism
	that quite astonished him. The Turkish chief had expected to find
	a wild undisciplined multitude, like that under Peter the Hermit,
	without leaders capable of enforcing obedience; instead of which,
	he found the most experienced leaders of the age at the head of
	armies that had just fanaticism enough to be ferocious, but not
	enough to render them ungovernable. In these engagements, many
	hundreds fell on both sides; and on both sides the most revolting
	barbarity was practised: the Crusaders cut off the heads of the
	fallen Mussulmans, and sent them in panniers to Constantinople,
	as trophies of their victory. After the temporary defeat of Kilij
	Aslaun, the siege of Nice was carried on with redoubled vigour.
	The Turks defended themselves with the greatest obstinacy, and
	discharged showers of poisoned arrows upon the Crusaders. When
	any unfortunate wretch was killed under the walls, they let down
	iron hooks from above, and drew the body up, which, after stripping
	and mutilating, they threw back again at the besiegers. The
	latter were well supplied with provisions, and for six-and-thirty
	days the siege continued without any relaxation of the efforts on
	either side. Many tales are told of the almost superhuman heroism
	of the Christian leaders—how one man put a thousand to flight; and
	how the arrows of the faithful never missed their mark. One anecdote
	of Godfrey of Bouillon, related by Albert of Aix, is worth recording,
	not only as shewing the high opinion entertained of his
	valour, but as shewing the contagious credulity of the armies—a credulity
	which as often led them to the very verge of defeat, as it incited
	them to victory. One Turk, of gigantic stature, took his station
	day by day on the battlements of Nice, and, bearing an enormous
	bow, committed great havoc among the Christian host. Not a shaft
	he sped but bore death upon its point; and although the Crusaders
	aimed repeatedly at his breast, and he stood in the most exposed
	position, their arrows fell harmless at his feet. He seemed to be
	invulnerable to attack; and a report was soon spread abroad, that he
	was no other than the Arch Fiend himself, and that mortal hand
	could not prevail against him. Godfrey of Bouillon, who had no
	faith in the supernatural character of the Mussulman, determined, if
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>possible, to put an end to the dismay which was rapidly paralysing
	the exertions of his best soldiers. Taking a huge cross-bow, he stood
	forward in front of the army, to try the steadiness of his hand against
	the much-dreaded archer: the shaft was aimed directly at his heart,
	and took fatal effect. The Moslem fell amid the groans of the besieged,
	and the shouts of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus adjuva! Deus adjuva!</em> the war-cry of
	the besiegers.</p>

	<p>At last the Crusaders imagined that they had overcome all obstacles,
	and were preparing to take possession of the city, when, to their
	great astonishment, they saw the flag of the Emperor Alexius flying
	from the battlements. An emissary of the emperor, named Faticius
	or Tatin, had contrived to gain admission, with a body of Greek
	troops, at a point which the Crusaders had left unprotected, and had
	persuaded the Turks to surrender to him rather than to the crusading
	forces. The greatest indignation prevailed in the army when
	this stratagem was discovered, and the soldiers were, with the utmost
	difficulty, prevented from renewing the attack and besieging the
	Greek emissary.</p>

	<p>The army, however, continued its march, and, by some means or
	other, was broken into two divisions; some historians say accidentally,<a href="#fn6" id="fnm6" title="Fulcher of Chartres..." class="fnmarker">6</a>
	while others affirm by mutual consent, and for the convenience
	of obtaining provisions on the way.<a href="#fn7" id="fnm7" title="William of Tyre..." class="fnmarker">7</a> The one division was
	composed of the forces under Bohemund, Tancred, and the Duke of
	Normandy; while the other, which took a route at some distance
	on the right, was commanded by Godfrey of Bouillon and the other
	chiefs. The Sultan of Roum, who, after his losses at Nice, had been
	silently making great efforts to crush the Crusaders at one blow, collected
	in a very short time all the multitudinous tribes that owed
	him allegiance, and with an army which, according to a moderate
	calculation, amounted to two hundred thousand men, chiefly cavalry,
	he fell upon the first division of the Christian host in the valley of
	Dorylæum. It was early in the morning of the 1st of July 1097,
	when the Crusaders saw the first companies of the Turkish horsemen
	pouring down upon them from the hills. Bohemund had hardly time
	to set himself in order, and transport his sick and helpless to the
	rear, when the overwhelming force of the Orientals was upon him.
	The Christian army, composed principally of men on foot, gave way
	on all sides, and the hoofs of the Turkish steeds, and the poisoned
	arrows of their bowmen, mowed them down by hundreds. After
	having lost the flower of their chivalry, the Christians retreated
	upon their baggage, when a dreadful slaughter took place. Neither
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>women nor children, nor the sick, were spared. Just as they were
	reduced to the last extremity, Godfrey of Bouillon and the Count of
	Toulouse made their appearance on the field, and turned the tide of
	battle. After an obstinate engagement the Turks fled, and their rich
	camp fell into the hands of the enemy. The loss of the Crusaders
	amounted to about four thousand men, with several chiefs of renown,
	among whom were Count Robert of Paris and William the brother of
	Tancred. The loss of the Turks, which did not exceed this number,
	taught them to pursue a different mode of warfare. The sultan was
	far from being defeated. With his still gigantic army, he laid waste
	all the country on either side of the Crusaders. The latter, who were
	unaware of the tactics of the enemy, found plenty of provisions in the
	Turkish camp; but so far from economising these resources, they
	gave themselves up for several days to the most unbounded extravagance.
	They soon paid dearly for their heedlessness. In the ravaged
	country of Phrygia, through which they advanced towards Antiochetta,
	they suffered dreadfully for want of food for themselves and
	pasture for their cattle. Above them was a scorching sun, almost
	sufficient of itself to dry up the freshness of the land, a task which
	the firebrands of the sultan had but too surely effected, and water
	was not to be had after the first day of their march. The pilgrims
	died at the rate of five hundred a day. The horses of the knights
	perished on the road, and the baggage which they had aided to transport
	was either placed upon dogs, sheep, and swine, or abandoned
	altogether. In some of the calamities that afterwards befell them,
	the Christians gave themselves up to the most reckless profligacy;
	but upon this occasion, the dissensions which prosperity had engendered
	were all forgotten. Religion, often disregarded, arose in the
	stern presence of misfortune, and cheered them as they died by the
	promises of eternal felicity.</p>

	<p>At length they reached Antiochetta, where they found water in
	abundance, and pastures for their expiring cattle. Plenty once more
	surrounded them, and here they pitched their tents. Untaught by
	the bitter experience of famine, they again gave themselves up to
	luxury and waste.</p>

	<p>On the 18th of October they sat down before the strong city of
	Antioch, the siege of which, and the events to which it gave rise, are
	among the most extraordinary incidents of the Crusade. The city,
	which is situated on an eminence, and washed by the river Orontes,
	is naturally a very strong position, and the Turkish garrison were
	well supplied with provisions to endure a long siege. In this respect
	the Christians were also fortunate, but unluckily for themselves, unwise.
	Their force amounted to three hundred thousand fighting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>men; and we are informed by Raymond d’Argilles, that they had so
	much provision, that they threw away the greater part of every animal
	they killed, being so dainty, that they would only eat particular
	parts of the beast. So insane was their extravagance, that in less
	than ten days famine began to stare them in the face. After making
	a fruitless attempt to gain possession of the city by a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</em>,
	they, starving themselves, sat down to starve out the enemy. But
	with want came a cooling of enthusiasm. The chiefs began to grow
	weary of the expedition. Baldwin had previously detached himself
	from the main body of the army, and, proceeding to Edessa, had intrigued
	himself into the supreme power in that little principality.
	The other leaders were animated with less zeal than heretofore. Stephen
	of Chartres and Hugh of Vermandois began to waver, unable
	to endure the privations which their own folly and profusion had
	brought upon them. Even Peter the Hermit became sick at heart
	ere all was over. When the famine had become so urgent that they
	were reduced to eat human flesh in the extremity of their hunger,
	Bohemund and Robert of Flanders set forth on an expedition to procure
	a supply. They were in a slight degree successful; but the relief they
	brought was not economised, and in two days they were as destitute
	as before. Faticius, the Greek commander and representative of
	Alexius, deserted with his division under pretence of seeking for food,
	and his example was followed by various bodies of Crusaders.</p>

	<p>Misery was rife among those who remained, and they strove to
	alleviate it by a diligent attention to signs and omens. These, with
	extraordinary visions seen by the enthusiastic, alternately cheered
	and depressed them according as they foretold the triumph or pictured
	the reverses of the cross. At one time a violent hurricane
	arose, levelling great trees with the ground, and blowing down the
	tents of the Christian leaders. At another time an earthquake shook
	the camp, and was thought to prognosticate some great impending
	evil to the cause of Christendom. But a comet which appeared
	shortly afterwards raised them from the despondency into which
	they had fallen; their lively imaginations making it assume the form
	of a flaming cross leading them on to victory. Famine was not the
	least of the evils they endured. Unwholesome food, and the impure
	air from the neighbouring marshes, engendered pestilential diseases,
	which carried them off more rapidly than the arrows of the enemy.
	A thousand of them died in a day, and it became at last a matter of
	extreme difficulty to afford them burial. To add to their misery,
	each man grew suspicious of his neighbour; for the camp was infested
	by Turkish spies, who conveyed daily to the besieged intelligence
	of the movements and distresses of the enemy. With a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>ferocity, engendered by despair, Bohemund caused two spies, whom he had
	detected, to be roasted alive in presence of the army, and within sight
	of the battlements of Antioch. But even this example failed to reduce
	their numbers, and the Turks continued to be as well informed as the
	Christians themselves of all that was passing in the camp.</p>

	<p>The news of the arrival of a reinforcement of soldiers from Europe,
	with an abundant stock of provisions, came to cheer them when reduced
	to the last extremity. The welcome succour landed at St.
	Simeon, the port of Antioch, and about six miles from that city.
	Thitherwards the famishing Crusaders proceeded in tumultuous bands,
	followed by Bohemund and the Count of Toulouse, with strong detachments
	of their retainers and vassals, to escort the supplies in
	safety to the camp. The garrison of Antioch, forewarned of this
	arrival, was on the alert, and a corps of Turkish archers was despatched
	to lie in ambuscade among the mountains and intercept
	their return. Bohemund, laden with provisions, was encountered in
	the rocky passes by the Turkish host. Great numbers of his followers
	were slain, and he himself had just time to escape to the camp with
	the news of his defeat. Godfrey of Bouillon, the Duke of Normandy,
	and the other leaders had heard the rumour of this battle, and were
	at that instant preparing for the rescue. The army was immediately
	in motion, animated both by zeal and by hunger, and marched so
	rapidly as to intercept the victorious Turks before they had time to
	reach Antioch with their spoil. A fierce battle ensued, which lasted
	from noon till the going down of the sun. The Christians gained
	and maintained the advantage, each man fighting as if upon himself
	alone had depended the fortune of the day. Hundreds of Turks
	perished in the Orontes, and more than two thousand were left dead
	upon the field of battle. All the provision was recaptured and
	brought in safety to the camp, whither the Crusaders returned singing
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alleluia!</em> or shouting <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus adjuva! Deus adjuva!</em></p>

	<p>This relief lasted for some days, and, had it been duly economised,
	would have lasted much longer; but the chiefs had no authority, and
	were unable to exercise any control over its distribution. Famine
	again approached with rapid strides, and Stephen count of Blois, not
	liking the prospect, withdrew from the camp with four thousand of
	his retainers, and established himself at Alexandretta. The moral
	influence of this desertion was highly prejudicial upon those who remained;
	and Bohemund, the most impatient and ambitious of the
	chiefs, foresaw that, unless speedily checked, it would lead to the
	utter failure of the expedition. It was necessary to act decisively; the
	army murmured at the length of the siege, and the sultan was collecting
	his forces to crush them. Against the efforts of the Crusaders
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>Antioch might have held out for months; but treason within effected
	that which courage without might have striven for in vain.</p>

	<p>Baghasihan, the Turkish prince or emir of Antioch, had under
	his command an Armenian of the name of Phirouz, whom he had
	entrusted with the defence of a tower on that part of the city wall
	which overlooked the passes of the mountains. Bohemund, by means
	of a spy who had embraced the Christian religion, and to whom he
	had given his own name at baptism, kept up a daily communication
	with this captain, and made him the most magnificent promises of
	reward, if he would deliver up his post to the Crusaders. Whether
	the proposal was first made by Bohemund or by the Armenian
	is uncertain, but that a good understanding soon existed between
	them is undoubted; and a night was fixed for the execution of
	the project. Bohemund communicated the scheme to Godfrey and
	the Count of Toulouse, with the stipulation that, if the city were
	won, he, as the soul of the enterprise, should enjoy the dignity of
	Prince of Antioch. The other leaders hesitated: ambition and jealousy
	prompted them to refuse their aid in furthering the views of
	the intriguer. More mature consideration decided them to acquiesce,
	and seven hundred of the bravest knights were chosen for the expedition,
	the real object of which, for fear of spies, was kept a profound
	secret from the rest of the army. When all was ready, a report was
	promulgated that the seven hundred were intended to form an ambuscade
	for a division of the sultan’s army, which was stated to be
	approaching.</p>

	<p>Every thing favoured the treacherous project of the Armenian
	captain, who, on his solitary watch-tower, received due intimation of
	the approach of the Crusaders. The night was dark and stormy; not
	a star was visible above, and the wind howled so furiously as to overpower
	all other sounds: the rain fell in torrents, and the watchers
	on the towers adjoining to that of Phirouz could not hear the tramp
	of the armed knights for the wind, nor see them for the obscurity of
	the night and the dismalness of the weather. When within shot of
	the walls, Bohemund sent forward an interpreter to confer with the
	Armenian. The latter urged them to make haste, and seize the favourable
	interval, as armed men, with lighted torches, patrolled the battlements
	every half hour, and at that instant they had just passed.
	The chiefs were instantly at the foot of the wall: Phirouz let down
	a rope; Bohemund attached it to the end of a ladder of hides, which
	was then raised by the Armenian, and held while the knights
	mounted. A momentary fear came over the spirits of the adventurers,
	and every one hesitated. At last Bohemund,<a href="#fn8" id="fnm8" title="Vide William of Tyre." class="fnmarker">8</a> encouraged by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>Phirouz from above, ascended a few steps on the ladder, and was
	followed by Godfrey, Count Robert of Flanders, and a number of
	other knights. As they advanced, others pressed forward, until their
	weight became too great for the ladder, which, breaking, precipitated
	about a dozen of them to the ground, where they fell one upon
	the other, making a great clatter with their heavy coats of mail. For
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>a moment they thought that all was lost; but the wind made so loud
	a howling as it swept in fierce gusts through the mountain gorges—and
	the Orontes, swollen by the rain, rushed so noisily along—that
	the guards heard nothing. The ladder was easily repaired, and the
	knights ascended two at a time, and reached the platform in safety.
	When sixty of them had thus ascended, the torch of the coming
	patrol was seen to gleam at the angle of the wall. Hiding themselves
	behind a buttress, they awaited his coming in breathless silence.
	As soon as he arrived at arm’s length, he was suddenly seized, and,
	before he could open his lips to raise an alarm, the silence of death
	closed them up for ever. They next descended rapidly the spiral
	staircase of the tower, and opening the portal, admitted the whole
	of their companions. Raymond of Toulouse, who, cognisant of the
	whole plan, had been left behind with the main body of the army,
	heard at this instant the signal horn, which announced that an entry
	had been effected, and, leading on his legions, the town was attacked
	from within and without.</p>

	<p>Imagination cannot conceive a scene more dreadful than that
	presented by the devoted city of Antioch on that night of horror.
	The Crusaders fought with a blind fury, which fanaticism and suffering
	alike incited. Men, women, and children were indiscriminately
	slaughtered, till the streets ran with blood. Darkness increased the
	destruction, for when morning dawned the Crusaders found themselves
	with their swords at the breasts of their fellow-soldiers, whom they
	had mistaken for foes. The Turkish commander fled, first to the
	citadel, and that becoming insecure, to the mountains, whither he
	was pursued and slain, and his grey head brought back to Antioch as
	a trophy. At daylight the massacre ceased, and the Crusaders gave
	themselves up to plunder. They found gold, and jewels, and silks,
	and velvets in abundance, but of provisions, which were of more
	importance to them, they found but little of any kind. Corn was
	excessively scarce, and they discovered to their sorrow that in this
	respect the besieged had been but little better off than the besiegers.</p>

		<p class="caption">SIEGE OF ANTIOCH.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Before they had time to instal themselves in their new position,
	and take the necessary measures for procuring a supply, the city was
	invested by the Turks. The sultan of Persia had raised an immense
	army, which he entrusted to the command of Kerbogha, the emir of
	Mosul, with instructions to sweep the Christian locusts from the face
	of the land. The emir effected a junction with Kilij Aslaun, and the
	two armies surrounded the city. Discouragement took complete possession
	of the Christian host, and numbers of them contrived to elude
	the vigilance of the besiegers, and escape to Count Stephen of Blois
	at Alexandretta, to whom they related the most exaggerated tales of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>the misery they had endured, and the utter hopelessness of continuing
	the war. Stephen forthwith broke up his camp and retreated
	towards Constantinople. On his way he was met by the Emperor
	Alexius, at the head of a considerable force, hastening to take possession
	of the conquests made by the Christians in Asia. As soon as he
	heard of their woful plight, he turned back, and proceeded with the
	Count of Blois to Constantinople, leaving the remnant of the Crusaders
	to shift for themselves.</p>

	<p>The news of this defection increased the discouragement at Antioch.
	All the useless horses of the army had been slain and eaten,
	and dogs, cats, and rats were sold at enormous prices. Even vermin
	were becoming scarce. With increasing famine came a pestilence, so
	that in a short time but sixty thousand remained of the three hundred
	thousand that had originally invested Antioch. But this bitter
	extremity, while it annihilated the energy of the host, only served to
	knit the leaders more firmly together; and Bohemund, Godfrey, and
	Tancred swore never to desert the cause as long as life lasted. The
	former strove in vain to reanimate the courage of his followers. They
	were weary and sick at heart, and his menaces and promises were
	alike thrown away. Some of them had shut themselves up in the
	houses, and refused to come forth. Bohemund, to drive them to
	their duty, set fire to the whole quarter, and many of them perished
	in the flames, while the rest of the army looked on with the utmost
	indifference. Bohemund, animated himself by a worldly spirit, did
	not know the true character of the Crusaders, nor understand the religious
	madness which had brought them in such shoals from Europe.
	A priest, more clear-sighted, devised a scheme which restored all their
	confidence, and inspired them with a courage so wonderful as to make
	the poor sixty thousand emaciated, sick, and starving zealots put to
	flight the well-fed and six times as numerous legions of the Sultan of
	Persia.</p>

	<p>This priest, a native of Provence, was named Peter Barthelemy,
	and whether he were a knave or an enthusiast, or both; a principal,
	or a tool in the hands of others, will ever remain a matter of doubt.
	Certain it is, however, that he was the means of raising the siege of
	Antioch, and causing the eventual triumph of the armies of the cross.
	When the strength of the Crusaders was completely broken by their
	sufferings, and hope had fled from every bosom, Peter came to Count
	Raymond of Toulouse, and demanded an interview on matters of
	serious moment. He was immediately admitted. He said that, some
	weeks previously, at the time the Christians were besieging Antioch,
	he was reposing alone in his tent, when he was startled by the shock
	of the earthquake, which had so alarmed the whole host. Through
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>violent terror of the shock he could only ejaculate, God help me!
	when turning round he saw two men standing before him, whom he
	at once recognised by the halo of glory around them as beings of
	another world. One of them appeared to be an aged man, with reddish
	hair sprinkled with grey, black eyes, and a long flowing grey
	beard. The other was younger, larger, and handsomer, and had something
	more divine in his aspect. The elderly man alone spoke, and
	informed him that he was the holy apostle St. Andrew, and desired
	him to seek out the Count Raymond, the Bishop of Puy, and Raymond
	of Altopulto, and ask them why the bishop did not exhort the
	people, and sign them with the cross which he bore. The apostle
	then took him, naked in his shirt as he was, and transported him
	through the air into the heart of the city of Antioch, where he led
	him into the church of St. Peter, at that time a Saracen mosque.
	The apostle made him stop by the pillar close to the steps by which
	they ascend on the south side to the altar, where hung two lamps,
	which gave out a light brighter than that of the noonday sun; the
	younger man, whom he did not at that time know, standing afar off,
	near the steps of the altar. The apostle then descended into the
	ground and brought up a lance, which he gave into his hand, telling
	him that it was the very lance that had opened the side whence had
	flowed the salvation of the world. With tears of joy he held the holy
	lance, and implored the apostle to allow him to take it away and
	deliver it into the hands of Count Raymond. The apostle refused,
	and buried the lance again in the ground, commanding him, when
	the city was won from the infidels, to go with twelve chosen men,
	and dig it up again in the same place. The apostle then transported
	him back to his tent, and the two vanished from his sight. He had
	neglected, he said, to deliver this message, afraid that his wonderful
	tale would not obtain credence from men of such high rank. After
	some days he again saw the holy vision, as he was gone out of the
	camp to look for food. This time the divine eyes of the younger
	looked reproachfully upon him. He implored the apostle to choose
	some one else more fitted for the mission, but the apostle refused,
	and smote him with a disorder of the eyes, as a punishment for his
	disobedience. With an obstinacy unaccountable even to himself, he
	had still delayed. A third time the apostle and his companion had
	appeared to him, as he was in a tent with his master William at St.
	Simeon. On that occasion St. Andrew told him to bear his command
	to the Count of Toulouse not to bathe in the waters of the Jordan
	when he came to it, but to cross over in a boat, clad in a shirt and
	breeches of linen, which he should sprinkle with the sacred waters of
	the river. These clothes he was afterwards to preserve along with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>the holy lance. His master William, although he could not see the
	saint, distinctly heard the voice giving orders to that effect. Again
	he neglected to execute the commission, and again the saints appeared
	to him, when he was at the port of Mamistra, about to sail for Cyprus,
	and St. Andrew threatened him with eternal perdition if he refused
	longer. Upon this he made up his mind to divulge all that had been
	revealed to him.</p>

	<p>The Count of Toulouse, who, in all probability, concocted this
	tale with the priest, appeared struck with the recital, and sent immediately
	for the Bishop of Puy and Raymond of Altapulto. The
	bishop at once expressed his disbelief of the whole story, and refused
	to have any thing to do in the matter. The Count of Toulouse,
	on the contrary, saw abundant motives, if not for believing, for
	pretending to believe; and, in the end, he so impressed upon the
	mind of the bishop the advantage that might be derived
	from it, in working up the popular mind to its former
	excitement, that the latter reluctantly agreed to make
	search in due form for the holy weapon. The day after
	the morrow was fixed upon for the ceremony; and, in
	the mean time, Peter was consigned to the care of Raymond,
	the count’s chaplain, in order that no profane
	curiosity might have an opportunity of cross-examining
	him, and putting him to a nonplus.</p>

	<p>Twelve devout men were forthwith chosen for the
	undertaking, among whom were the Count of Toulouse
	and his chaplain. They began digging at sunrise, and
	continued unwearied till near sunset, without finding the
	lance; they might have dug till this day with no better
	success, had not Peter himself sprung into the pit, praying
	to God to bring the lance to light, for the strengthening
	and victory of his people. Those who hide know
	where to find; and so it was with Peter, for both he and
	the lance found their way into the hole at the same
	time. On a sudden, he and Raymond the chaplain
	beheld its point in the earth, and Raymond, drawing
	it forth, kissed it with tears of joy, in sight of the
	multitude which had assembled in the church. It was
	immediately enveloped in a rich purple cloth, already
	prepared to receive it, and exhibited in this state to
	the faithful, who made the building resound with their
	shouts of gladness.</p>

		<p class="caption">THE HOLY LANCE.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Peter had another vision the same night, and became from that
	day forth “dreamer of dreams” in general to the army. He stated
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>on the following day, that the Apostle Andrew and “the youth with
	the divine aspect” appeared to him again, and directed that the Count
	of Toulouse, as a reward for his persevering piety, should carry the
	Holy Lance at the head of the army, and that the day on which it was
	found should be observed as a solemn festival throughout Christendom.
	St. Andrew shewed him at the same time the holes in the feet
	and hands of his benign companion; and he became convinced that
	he stood in the awful presence of <span class="first_word">the Redeemer</span>.</p>

	<p>Peter gained so much credit by his visions that dreaming became
	contagious. Other monks beside himself were visited by the saints,
	who promised victory to the host if it would valiantly hold out to the
	last, and crowns of eternal glory to those who fell in the fight. Two
	deserters, wearied of the fatigues and privations of the war, who had
	stealthily left the camp, suddenly returned, and seeking Bohemund,
	told him that they had been met by two apparitions, who, with great
	anger, had commanded them to return. The one of them said, that he
	recognised his brother, who had been killed in battle some months
	before, and that he had a halo of glory around his head. The other,
	still more hardy, asserted that the apparition which had spoken to
	him was the Saviour himself, who had promised eternal happiness as
	his reward if he returned to his duty, but the pains of eternal fire if
	he rejected the cross. No one thought of disbelieving these men.
	The courage of the army immediately revived; despondency gave
	way to hope; every arm grew strong again, and the pangs of hunger
	were for a time disregarded. The enthusiasm which had led them
	from Europe, burned forth once more as brightly as ever, and they
	demanded, with loud cries, to be led against the enemy. The leaders
	were not unwilling. In a battle lay their only chance of salvation;
	and although Godfrey, Bohemund, and Tancred received the story of
	the lance with much suspicion, they were too wise to throw discredit
	upon an imposture which bade fair to open the gates of victory.</p>

	<p>Peter the Hermit was previously sent to the camp of Kerbogha
	to propose that the quarrel between the two religions should be decided
	by a chosen number of the bravest soldiers of each army. Kerbogha
	turned from him with a look of contempt, and said he could
	agree to no proposals from a set of such miserable beggars and robbers.
	With this uncourteous answer Peter returned to Antioch. Preparations
	were immediately commenced for an attack upon the enemy:
	the latter continued to be perfectly well informed of all the proceedings
	of the Christian camp. The citadel of Antioch, which remained
	in their possession, overlooked the town, and the commander of the
	fortress could distinctly see all that was passing within. On the
	morning of the 28th of June, 1098, a black flag, hoisted from its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>highest tower, announced to the besieging army that the Christians
	were about to sally forth.</p>

	<p>The Moslem leaders knew the sad inroads that famine and disease
	had made upon the numbers of the foe; they knew that not above
	two hundred of the knights had horses to ride upon, and that the
	foot soldiers were sick and emaciated; but they did not know the
	almost incredible valour which superstition had infused into their
	hearts. The story of the lance they treated with the most supreme
	contempt, and, secure of an easy victory, they gave themselves no
	trouble in preparing for the onslaught. It is related that Kerbogha
	was playing a game at chess, when the black flag on the citadel gave
	warning of the enemy’s approach, and that, with true oriental coolness,
	he insisted upon finishing the game ere he bestowed any of his
	attention upon a foe so unworthy. The defeat of his advanced post
	of two thousand men aroused him from his apathy.</p>

	<p>The Crusaders, after this first victory, advanced joyfully towards
	the mountains, hoping to draw the Turks to a place where their
	cavalry would be unable to manœuvre. Their spirits were light and
	their courage high, as, led on by the Duke of Normandy, Count
	Robert of Flanders, and Hugh of Vermandois, they came within
	sight of the splendid camp of the enemy. Godfrey of Bouillon and
	Adhemar Bishop of Puy, followed immediately after these leaders,
	the latter clad in complete armour, and bearing the Holy Lance
	within sight of the whole army: Bohemund and Tancred brought up
	the rear.</p>

	<p>Kerbogha, aware at last that his enemy was not so despicable,
	took vigorous measures to remedy his mistake, and, preparing himself
	to meet the Christians in front, he despatched the Sultan Soliman
	of Roum to attack them in the rear. To conceal this movement, he
	set fire to the dried weeds and grass with which the ground was
	covered, and Soliman, taking a wide circuit with his cavalry, succeeded,
	under cover of the smoke, in making good his position in the
	rear. The battle raged furiously in front; the arrows of the Turks
	fell thick as hail, and their well-trained squadrons trod the Crusaders
	under their hoofs like stubble. Still the affray was doubtful; for
	the Christians had the advantage of the ground, and were rapidly
	gaining upon the enemy, when the overwhelming forces of Soliman
	arrived in the rear. Godfrey and Tancred flew to the rescue of Bohemund,
	spreading dismay in the Turkish ranks by their fierce impetuosity.
	The Bishop of Puy was left almost alone with the Provençals
	to oppose the legions commanded by Kerbogha in person; but
	the presence of the Holy Lance made a hero of the meanest soldier in
	his train. Still, however, the numbers of the enemy seemed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>interminable. The Christians, attacked on every side, began at last to
	give way, and the Turks made sure of victory.</p>

	<p>At this moment a cry was raised in the Christian host that the
	saints were fighting on their side. The battle-field was clear of the
	smoke from the burning weeds, which had curled away, and hung in
	white clouds of fantastic shape on the brow of the distant mountains.
	Some imaginative zealot, seeing this dimly through the dust of the
	battle, called out to his fellows, to look at the army of saints, clothed
	in white, and riding upon white horses, that were pouring over the
	hills to the rescue. All eyes were immediately turned to the distant
	smoke; faith was in every heart; and the old battle-cry, <em>God wills it!
	God wills it!</em> resounded through the field, as every soldier, believing
	that God was visibly sending his armies to his aid, fought with an
	energy unfelt before. A panic seized the Persian and Turkish hosts,
	and they gave way in all directions. In vain Kerbogha tried to rally
	them. Fear is more contagious than enthusiasm, and they fled over
	the mountains like deer pursued by the hounds. The two leaders,
	seeing the uselessness of further efforts, fled with the rest; and that
	immense army was scattered over Palestine, leaving nearly seventy
	thousand of its dead upon the field of battle.</p>

	<p>Their magnificent camp fell into the hands of the enemy, with its
	rich stores of corn, and its droves of sheep and oxen. Jewels, gold, and
	rich velvets in abundance were distributed among the army. Tancred
	followed the fugitives over the hills, and reaped as much plunder as
	those who had remained in the camp. The way, as they fled, was
	covered with valuables, and horses of the finest breed of Arabia became
	so plentiful that every knight of the Christians was provided
	with a steed. The Crusaders, in this battle, acknowledge to have lost
	nearly ten thousand men.</p>

	<p>Their return to Antioch was one of joy indeed: the citadel was
	surrendered at once, and many of the Turkish garrison embraced the
	Christian faith, and the rest were suffered to depart. A solemn thanksgiving
	was offered up by the Bishop of Puy, in which the whole army
	joined, and the Holy Lance was visited by every soldier.</p>

	<p>The enthusiasm lasted for some days, and the army loudly demanded
	to be led forward to Jerusalem, the grand goal of all their
	wishes: but none of their leaders was anxious to move;—the more
	prudent among them, such as Godfrey and Tancred, for reasons of
	expediency; and the more ambitious, such as the Count of Toulouse
	and Bohemund, for reasons of self-interest. Violent dissensions sprang
	up again between all the chiefs. Raymond of Toulouse, who was left
	at Antioch to guard the town, had summoned the citadel to surrender,
	as soon as he saw that there was no fear of any attack upon the part of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>the Persians; and the other chiefs found, upon their return, his banner
	waving on its walls. This had given great offence to Bohemund,
	who had stipulated the principality of Antioch as his reward for winning
	the town in the first instance. Godfrey and Tancred supported
	his claim, and, after a great deal of bickering, the flag of Raymond
	was lowered from the tower, and that of Bohemund hoisted in its
	stead, who assumed from that time the title of Prince of Antioch.
	Raymond, however, persisted in retaining possession of one of the
	city gates and its adjacent towers, which he held for several months,
	to the great annoyance of Bohemund and the scandal of the army.
	The count became in consequence extremely unpopular, although his
	ambition was not a whit more unreasonable than that of Bohemund
	himself, nor of Baldwin, who had taken up his quarters at Edessa,
	where he exercised the functions of a petty sovereign.</p>

	<p>The fate of Peter Barthelemy deserves to be recorded. Honours
	and consideration had come thick upon him after the affair of the
	lance, and he consequently felt bound in conscience to continue the
	dreams which had made him a personage of so much importance. The
	mischief of it was, that, like many other liars, he had a very bad memory,
	and he contrived to make his dreams contradict each other in
	the most palpable manner. St. John one night appeared to him, and
	told one tale; while, a week after, St. Paul told a totally different
	story, and held out hopes quite incompatible with those of his apostolic
	brother. The credulity of that age had a wide maw, and Peter’s
	visions must have been absurd and outrageous indeed, when the very
	men who had believed in the lance refused to swallow any more of his
	wonders. Bohemund at last, for the purpose of annoying the Count
	of Toulouse, challenged poor Peter to prove the truth of his story of
	the lance by the fiery ordeal. Peter could not refuse a trial so common
	in that age, and being besides encouraged by the count and his
	chaplain Raymond, an early day was appointed for the ceremony.
	The previous night was spent in prayer and fasting, according to custom,
	and Peter came forth in the morning bearing the lance in his
	hand, and walked boldly up to the fire. The whole army gathered
	round, impatient for the result, many thousands still believing that
	the lance was genuine, and Peter a holy man. Prayers having been
	said by Raymond d’Agilles, Peter walked into the flames, and had got
	nearly through, when pain caused him to lose his presence of mind:
	the heat too affected his eyes, and, in his anguish, he turned round
	unwittingly, and passed through the fire again, instead of stepping
	out of it, as he should have done. The result was, that he was burned
	so severely that he never recovered, and, after lingering for some days,
	he expired in great agony.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>Most of the soldiers were suffering either from wounds, disease,
	or weariness; and it was resolved by Godfrey,—the tacitly acknowledged
	chief of the enterprise,—that the army should have time to
	refresh itself ere they advanced upon Jerusalem. It was now July, and
	he proposed that they should pass the hot months of August and
	September within the walls of Antioch, and march forward in October
	with renewed vigour, and numbers increased by fresh arrivals
	from Europe. This advice was finally adopted, although the enthusiasts
	of the army continued to murmur at the delay. In the mean
	time the Count of Vermandois was sent upon an embassy to the Emperor
	Alexius at Constantinople, to reproach him for his base desertion
	of the cause, and urge him to send the reinforcements he had
	promised. The count faithfully executed his mission (of which, by
	the way, Alexius took no notice whatever), and remained for some
	time at Constantinople, till his zeal, never very violent, totally evaporated.
	He then returned to France, sick of the Crusade, and determined
	to intermeddle with it no more.</p>

	<p>The chiefs, though they had determined to stay at Antioch for
	two months, could not remain quiet for so long a time. They would,
	in all probability, have fallen upon each other, had there been no
	Turks in Palestine upon whom they might vent their impetuosity.
	Godfrey proceeded to Edessa, to aid his brother Baldwin in expelling
	the Saracens from his principality, and the other leaders carried on
	separate hostilities against them as caprice or ambition dictated. At
	length the impatience of the army to be led against Jerusalem became
	so great that the chiefs could no longer delay, and Raymond, Tancred,
	and Robert of Normandy marched forward with their divisions, and
	laid siege to the small but strong town of Marah. With their usual
	improvidence, they had not food enough to last a beleaguering army
	for a week. They suffered great privations in consequence, till Bohemund
	came to their aid and took the town by storm. In connexion
	with this siege, the chronicler, Raymond d’Agilles (the same Raymond
	the chaplain who figured in the affair of the Holy Lance),
	relates a legend, in the truth of which he devoutly believed, and upon
	which Tasso has founded one of the most beautiful passages of his
	poem. It is worth preserving, as shewing the spirit of the age and
	the source of the extraordinary courage manifested by the Crusaders
	on occasions of extreme difficulty. “One day,” says Raymond, “Anselme
	de Ribeaumont beheld young Engelram, the son of the Count
	de St. Paul, who had been killed at Marah, enter his tent. ‘How is
	it,’ said Anselme to him, ‘that you, whom I saw lying dead on the
	field of battle, are full or life?’—‘You must know,’ replied Engelram,
	‘that those who fight for Jesus Christ never die.’ ‘But whence,’
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>resumed Anselme, ‘comes that strange brightness that surrounds you?’
	Upon this Engelram pointed to the sky, where Anselme saw a palace
	of diamond and crystal. ‘It is thence,’ said he, ‘that I derive the
	beauty which surprises you. My dwelling is there; a still finer one is
	prepared for you, and you shall soon come to inhabit it. Farewell!
	we shall meet again to-morrow.’ With these words Engelram returned
	to heaven. Anselme, struck by the vision, sent the next morning
	for the priests, received the sacrament, and although full of health,
	took a last farewell of all his friends, telling them that he was about
	to leave this world. A few hours afterwards, the enemy having made
	a sortie, Anselme went out against them sword in hand, and was
	struck on the forehead by a stone from a Turkish sling, which sent
	him to heaven, to the beautiful palace that was prepared for him.”</p>

		<p class="caption">SHRINE OF THE NATIVITY.</p>
	</div>

	<p>New disputes arose between the Prince of Antioch and the Count
	of Toulouse with regard to the capture of this town, which were with
	the utmost difficulty appeased by the other chiefs. Delays also took
	place in the progress of the army, especially before Archas, and the
	soldiery were so exasperated that they were on the point of choosing
	new leaders to conduct them to Jerusalem. Godfrey, upon this, set
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>fire to his camp at Archas, and marched forward. He was immediately
	joined by hundreds of the Provençals of the Count of Toulouse.
	The latter, seeing the turn affairs were taking, hastened after them,
	and the whole host proceeded towards the holy city, so long desired
	amid sorrow, and suffering, and danger. At Emmaus they were met
	by a deputation from the Christians of Bethlehem, praying for immediate
	aid against the oppression of the infidels. The very name of
	Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Saviour, was music to their ears,
	and many of them wept with joy to think they were approaching
	a spot so hallowed. Albert of Aix informs us that their hearts were
	so touched that sleep was banished from the camp, and that, instead
	of waiting till the morning’s dawn to recommence their march, they
	set out shortly after midnight, full of hope and enthusiasm. For upwards
	of four hours the mail-clad legions tramped stedfastly forward
	in the dark, and when the sun arose in unclouded splendour, the
	towers and pinnacles of Jerusalem gleamed upon their sight. All the
	tender feelings of their nature were touched; no longer brutal fanatics,
	but meek and humble pilgrims, they knelt down upon the sod,
	and with tears in their eyes, exclaimed to one another “<em>Jerusalem!
	Jerusalem!</em>” Some of them kissed the holy ground, others stretched
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>themselves at full length upon it, in order that their bodies might
	come in contact with the greatest possible extent of it, and others
	prayed aloud. The women and children who had followed the camp
	from Europe, and shared in all its dangers, fatigues, and privations,
	were more boisterous in their joy; the former from long-nourished
	enthusiasm, and the latter from mere imitation,<a href="#fn9" id="fnm9" title="Guibert de Nogent relates..." class="fnmarker">9</a> and prayed, and
	wept, and laughed till they almost put the more sober to the blush.</p>

		<p class="caption">THE PILGRIMS AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF JERUSALEM.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The first ebullition of their gladness having subsided, the army
	marched forward, and invested the city on all sides. The assault was
	almost immediately begun; but after the Christians had lost some of
	their bravest knights, that mode of attack was abandoned, and the
	army commenced its preparations for a regular siege. Mangonels,
	moveable towers, and battering-rams, together with a machine called
	a sow, made of wood, and covered with raw hides, inside of which
	miners worked to undermine the walls, were forthwith constructed;
	and to restore the courage and discipline of the army, which had suffered
	from the unworthy dissensions of the chiefs, the latter held out
	the hand of friendship to each other, and Tancred and the Count of
	Toulouse embraced in sight of the whole camp. The clergy aided the
	cause with their powerful voice, and preached union and goodwill to
	the highest and the lowest. A solemn procession was also ordered
	round the city, in which the entire army joined, prayers being offered
	up at every spot which gospel records had taught them to consider as
	peculiarly sacred.</p>

	<p>The Saracens upon the ramparts beheld all these manifestations
	without alarm. To incense the Christians, whom they despised, they
	constructed rude crosses, and fixed them upon the walls, and spat
	upon and pelted them with dirt and stones. This insult to the symbol
	of their faith raised the wrath of the Crusaders to that height
	that bravery became ferocity, and enthusiasm madness. When all
	the engines of war were completed, the attack was recommenced,
	and every soldier of the Christian army fought with a vigour which
	the sense of private wrong invariably inspires. Every man had been
	personally outraged, and the knights worked at the battering-rams
	with as much readiness as the meanest soldiers. The Saracen arrows
	and balls of fire fell thick and fast among them, but the tremendous
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>rams still heaved against the walls, while the best marksmen of the
	host were busily employed in the several floors of the moveable
	towers in dealing death among the Turks upon the battlements.
	Godfrey, Raymond, Tancred, and Robert of Normandy, each upon
	his tower, fought for hours with unwearied energy, often repulsed,
	but ever ready to renew the struggle. The Turks, no longer despising
	the enemy, defended themselves with the utmost skill and bravery
	till darkness brought a cessation of hostilities. Short was the sleep
	that night in the Christian camp. The priests offered up solemn
	prayers in the midst of the attentive soldiery for the triumph of the
	cross in this last great struggle; and as soon as morning dawned, every
	one was in readiness for the affray. The women and children lent their
	aid, the latter running unconcerned to and fro while the arrows fell
	fast around them, bearing water to the thirsty combatants. The saints
	were believed to be aiding their efforts, and the army, impressed
	with this idea, surmounted difficulties under which a force thrice as
	numerous, but without their faith, would have quailed and been
	defeated. Raymond of Toulouse at last forced his way into the city
	by escalade, while at the very same moment Tancred and Robert of
	Normandy succeeded in bursting open one of the gates. The Turks
	flew to repair the mischief, and Godfrey of Bouillon, seeing the battlements
	comparatively deserted, let down the drawbridge of his
	moveable tower, and sprang forward, followed by all the knights
	of his train. In an instant after, the banner of the cross floated
	upon the walls of Jerusalem. The Crusaders, raising once more their
	redoubtable war-cry, rushed on from every side, and the city was
	taken. The battle raged in the streets for several hours, and the
	Christians, remembering their insulted faith, gave no quarter to
	young or old, male or female, sick or strong. Not one of the leaders
	thought himself at liberty to issue orders for staying the carnage,
	and if he had, he would not have been obeyed. The Saracens fled in
	great numbers to the mosque of Soliman, but they had not time to
	fortify themselves within it ere the Christians were upon them. Ten
	thousand persons are said to have perished in that building alone.</p>

	<p>Peter the Hermit, who had remained so long under the veil of
	neglect, was repaid that day for all his zeal and all his sufferings.
	As soon as the battle was over, the Christians of Jerusalem issued
	forth from their hiding-places to welcome their deliverers. They
	instantly recognised the Hermit as the pilgrim who, years before,
	had spoken to them so eloquently of the wrongs and insults they had
	endured, and promised to stir up the princes and people of Europe
	in their behalf. They clung to the skirts of his garments in the fervour
	of their gratitude, and vowed to remember him for ever in their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>prayers. Many of them shed tears about his neck, and attributed
	the deliverance of Jerusalem solely to his courage and perseverance.
	Peter afterwards held some ecclesiastical office in the holy city, but
	what it was, or what was his ultimate fate, history has forgotten to
	inform us. Some say that he returned to France and founded a monastery,
	but the story does not rest upon sufficient authority.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>The grand object for which the popular swarms of Europe had
	forsaken their homes was now accomplished. The Moslem mosques
	of Jerusalem were converted into churches for a purer faith, and the
	mount of Calvary and the sepulchre of Christ were profaned no longer
	by the presence or the power of the infidel. Popular frenzy had fulfilled
	its mission, and, as a natural consequence, it began to subside
	from that time forth. The news of the capture of Jerusalem brought
	numbers of pilgrims from Europe, and, among others, Stephen count
	of Chartres and Hugh of Vermandois, to atone for their desertion;
	but nothing like the former enthusiasm existed among the nations.</p>

	<p>Thus then ends the history of the first Crusade. For the better
	understanding of the second, it will be necessary to describe the interval
	between them, and to enter into a slight sketch of the history
	of Jerusalem under its Latin kings, the long and fruitless wars they
	continued to wage with the unvanquished Saracens, and the poor
	and miserable results which sprang from so vast an expenditure of
	zeal, and so deplorable a waste of human life.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The necessity of having some recognised chief was soon felt by the
	Crusaders, and Godfrey de Bouillon, less ambitious than Bohemund
	or Raymond of Toulouse, gave his cold consent to wield a sceptre
	which the latter chiefs would have clutched with eagerness. He was
	hardly invested with the royal mantle before the Saracens menaced
	his capital. With much vigour and judgment he exerted himself to
	follow up the advantages he had gained, and marching out to meet
	the enemy before they had time to besiege him in Jerusalem, he gave
	them battle at Ascalon, and defeated them with great loss. He did
	not, however, live long to enjoy his new dignity, being seized with a
	fatal illness when he had only reigned nine months. To him succeeded
	his brother, Baldwin of Edessa. The latter monarch did much
	to improve the condition of Jerusalem and to extend its territory, but
	was not able to make a firm footing for his successors. For fifty years,
	in which the history of Jerusalem is full of interest to the historical
	student, the Crusaders were exposed to fierce and constant hostilities,
	often gaining battles and territory, and as often losing them, but becoming
	every day weaker and more divided, while the Saracens became
	stronger and more united to harass and root them out. The battles
	of this period were of the most chivalrous character, and deeds of
	heroism were done by the handful of brave knights that remained in
	Syria, which have hardly their parallel in the annals of war. In the
	course of time, however, the Christians could not avoid feeling some
	respect for the courage, and admiration for the polished manners and
	advanced civilisation of the Saracens, so much superior to the rudeness
	and semi-barbarism of Europe at that day. Difference of faith
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>did not prevent them from forming alliances with the dark-eyed
	maidens of the East. One of the first to set the example of taking
	a Paynim spouse was King
	Baldwin himself, and these
	connexions in time became
	not only frequent, but almost
	universal, among such
	of the knights as had resolved
	to spend their lives in Palestine.
	These Eastern ladies
	were obliged, however,
	to submit to the ceremony
	of baptism before they could
	be received to the arms of a
	Christian lord. These, and
	their offspring, naturally
	looked upon the Saracens
	with less hatred than did the
	zealots who conquered Jerusalem,
	and who thought
	it a sin deserving the wrath
	of God to spare an unbeliever.
	We find, in consequence,
	that the most obstinate
	battles waged during
	the reigns of the later kings
	of Jerusalem were fought
	by the new and raw levies
	who from time to time arrived from Europe, lured by the hope of
	glory or spurred by fanaticism. The latter broke without scruple the
	truces established between the original settlers and the Saracens, and
	drew down severe retaliation upon many thousands of their brethren
	in the faith, whose prudence was stronger than their zeal, and whose
	chief desire was to live in peace.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Things remained in this unsatisfactory state till the close of the
	year 1145, when Edessa, the strong frontier town of the Christian
	kingdom, fell into the hands of the Saracens. The latter were commanded
	by Zenghi, a powerful and enterprising monarch, and, after
	his death, by his son Nourheddin, as powerful and enterprising as his
	father. An unsuccessful attempt was made by the Count of Edessa
	to regain the fortress, but Nourheddin with a large army came to the
	rescue, and after defeating the count with great slaughter, marched
	into Edessa and caused its fortifications to be razed to the ground,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>that the town might never more be a bulwark of defence for the kingdom
	of Jerusalem. The road to the capital was now open, and consternation
	seized the hearts of the Christians. Nourheddin, it was
	known, was only waiting for a favourable opportunity to advance upon
	Jerusalem, and the armies of the cross, weakened and divided, were
	not in a condition to make any available resistance. The clergy were
	filled with grief and alarm, and wrote repeated letters to the Pope
	and the sovereigns of Europe, urging the expediency of a new Crusade
	for the relief of Jerusalem. By far the greater number of the priests
	of Palestine were natives of France, and these naturally looked first
	to their own country. The solicitations they sent to Louis VII.
	were urgent and oft repeated, and the chivalry of France began to
	talk once more of arming in defence of the birthplace of Jesus. The
	kings of Europe, whose interest it had not been to take any part
	in the first Crusade, began to bestir themselves in this; and a man
	appeared, eloquent as Peter the Hermit, to arouse the people as that
	preacher had done.</p>

	<p>We find, however, that the enthusiasm of the second did not equal
	that of the first Crusade; in fact, the mania had reached its climax
	in the time of Peter the Hermit, and decreased regularly from that
	period. The third Crusade was less general than the second, and the
	fourth than the third, and so on, until the public enthusiasm was
	quite extinct, and Jerusalem returned at last to the dominion of its
	old masters without a convulsion in Christendom. Various reasons
	have been assigned for this; and one very generally put forward is,
	that Europe was wearied with continued struggles, and had become
	sick of “precipitating itself upon Asia.” M. Guizot, in his admirable
	lectures upon European civilisation, successfully combats this opinion,
	and offers one of his own, which is far more satisfactory. He says,
	in his eighth lecture, “It has been often repeated that Europe was
	tired of continually invading Asia. This expression appears to me
	exceedingly incorrect. It is not possible that human beings can be
	wearied with what they have not done—that the labours of their
	forefathers can fatigue them. Weariness is a personal, not an inherited
	feeling. The men of the thirteenth century were not fatigued
	by the Crusades of the twelfth. They were influenced by another
	cause. A great change had taken place in ideas, sentiments, and
	social conditions. The same desires and the same wants were no
	longer felt. The same things were no longer believed. The people
	refused to believe what their ancestors were persuaded of.”</p>

	<p>This is, in fact, the secret of the change; and its truth becomes
	more apparent as we advance in the history of the Crusades, and compare
	the state of the public mind at the different periods when
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>Godfrey of Bouillon, Louis VII., and Richard I., were chiefs and leaders
	of the movement. The Crusades themselves were the means of operating
	a great change in national ideas, and advancing the civilisation
	of Europe. In the time of Godfrey, the nobles were all-powerful and
	all-oppressive, and equally obnoxious to kings and people. During
	their absence along with that portion of the community the deepest
	sunk in ignorance and superstition, both kings and people fortified
	themselves against the renewal of aristocratic tyranny, and in proportion
	as they became free became civilised. It was during this period
	that in France, the grand centre of the crusading madness, the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communes</em>
	began to acquire strength, and the monarch to possess a practical
	and not a merely theoretic authority. Order and comfort began to
	take root, and, when the second Crusade was preached, men were in
	consequence much less willing to abandon their homes than they had
	been during the first. Such pilgrims as had returned from the Holy
	Land came back with minds more liberal and expanded than when
	they set out. They had come in contact with a people more civilised
	than themselves; they had seen something more of the world, and had
	lost some portion, however small, of the prejudice and bigotry of
	ignorance. The institution of chivalry had also exercised its humanising
	influence, and coming bright and fresh through the ordeal of
	the Crusades, had softened the character and improved the hearts of
	the aristocratic order. The <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trouvères</em> and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Troubadours</em>, singing of love
	and war in strains pleasing to every class of society, helped to root
	out the gloomy superstitions which, at the first Crusade, filled the
	minds of all those who were able to think. Men became in consequence
	less exclusively under the mental thraldom of the priesthood,
	and lost much of the credulity which formerly distinguished them.</p>

	<p>The Crusades appear never to have excited so much attention in
	England as on the continent of Europe; not because the people were
	less fanatical than their neighbours, but because they were occupied
	in matters of graver interest. The English were suffering too severely
	from the recent successful invasion of their soil, to have much sympathy
	to bestow upon the distresses of people so far away as the
	Christians of Palestine; and we find that they took no part in the
	first Crusade, and very little in the second. Even then those who
	engaged in it were chiefly Norman knights and their vassals, and not
	the Saxon franklins and population, who no doubt thought, in their
	sorrow, as many wise men have thought since, that charity should
	begin at home.</p>

	<p>Germany was productive of more zeal in the cause, and her raw
	uncivilised hordes continued to issue forth under the banners of the
	cross in numbers apparently undiminished, when the enthusiasm had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>long been on the wane in other countries. They were sunk at that
	time in a deeper slough of barbarism than the livelier nations around
	them, and took, in consequence, a longer period to free themselves
	from their prejudices. In fact the second Crusade drew its chief
	supplies of men from that quarter, where alone the expedition can
	be said to have retained any portion of popularity.</p>

	<p>Such was the state of mind of Europe when Pope Eugenius,
	moved by the reiterated entreaties of the Christians of Syria, commissioned
	St. Bernard to preach a new Crusade. St. Bernard was a
	man eminently qualified for the mission. He was endowed with an
	eloquence of the highest order, could move an auditory to tears, or
	laughter, or fury, as it pleased him, and had led a life of such rigid
	and self-denying virtue, that not even calumny could lift her finger and
	point it at him. He had renounced high prospects in the Church,
	and contented himself with the simple abbacy of Clairvaux, in order
	that he might have the leisure he desired, to raise his powerful voice
	against abuses wherever he found them. Vice met in him an austere
	and uncompromising reprover; no man was too high for his reproach,
	and none too low for his sympathy. He was just as well suited for
	his age as Peter the Hermit had been for the age preceding. He
	appealed more to the reason, his predecessor to the passions; Peter
	the Hermit collected a mob, while St. Bernard collected an army.
	Both were endowed with equal zeal and perseverance, springing in
	the one from impulse, and in the other from conviction, and a desire
	to increase the influence of the Church, that great body of which he
	was a pillar and an ornament.</p>

		<p class="caption">CATHEDRAL OF VEZELAI.</p>
	</div>

	<p>One of the first converts he made was in himself a host. Louis
	VII. was both superstitious and tyrannical, and, in a fit of remorse for
	the infamous slaughter he had authorised at the sacking of Vitry,
	he made a vow to undertake the journey to the Holy Land.<a href="#fn10" id="fnm10" title="The sacking of Vitry..." class="fnmarker">10</a> He was
	in this disposition when St. Bernard began to preach, and wanted but
	little persuasion to embark in the cause. His example had great influence
	upon the nobility, who, impoverished as many of them were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>by the sacrifices made by their fathers in the holy wars, were anxious
	to repair their ruined fortunes by conquests on a foreign shore.
	These took the field with such vassals as they could command, and
	in a very short time an army was raised amounting to two hundred
	thousand men. At Vezelai the monarch received the cross from the
	hands of St. Bernard, on a platform elevated in sight of all the people.
	Several nobles, three bishops, and his queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine,
	were present at this ceremony, and enrolled themselves under
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>the banner of the cross, St. Bernard cutting up his red sacerdotal
	vestments, and making crosses of them, to be sewn on the shoulders
	of the people. An exhortation from the Pope was read to the multitude,
	granting remission of their sins to all who should join the Crusade,
	and directing that no man on that holy pilgrimage should encumber
	himself with heavy baggage and vain superfluities, and that
	the nobles should not travel with dogs or falcons, to lead them
	from the direct road, as had happened to so many during the first
	Crusade.</p>

	<p>The command of the army was offered to St. Bernard; but he
	wisely refused to accept a station for which his habits had unqualified
	him. After consecrating Louis with great solemnity, at St. Denis,
	as chief of the expedition, he continued his course through the country,
	stirring up the people wherever he went. So high an opinion
	was entertained of his sanctity, that he was thought to be animated
	by the spirit of prophecy, and to be gifted with the power of working
	miracles. Many women, excited by his eloquence, and encouraged
	by his predictions, forsook their husbands and children, and, clothing
	themselves in male attire, hastened to the war. St. Bernard
	himself wrote a letter to the Pope detailing his success, and stating,
	that in several towns there did not remain a single male inhabitant
	capable of bearing arms, and that every where castles and towns were
	to be seen filled with women weeping for their absent husbands. But
	in spite of this apparent enthusiasm, the numbers who really took up
	arms were inconsiderable, and not to be compared to the swarms of
	the first Crusade. A levy of no more than two hundred thousand
	men, which was the utmost the number amounted to, could hardly
	have depopulated a country like France, to the extent mentioned
	by St. Bernard. His description of the state of the country appears,
	therefore, to have been much more poetical than true.</p>

	<p>Suger, the able minister of Louis, endeavoured to dissuade him
	from undertaking so long a journey at a time when his own dominions
	so much needed his presence. But the king was pricked in his conscience
	by the cruelties of Vitry, and was anxious to make the only
	reparation which the religion of that day considered sufficient. He
	was desirous, moreover, of testifying to the world, that though he
	could brave the temporal power of the Church when it encroached
	upon his prerogatives, he could render all due obedience to its spiritual
	decrees whenever it suited his interest or tallied with his prejudices
	to do so. Suger, therefore, implored in vain, and Louis
	received the pilgrim’s staff at St. Denis, and made all preparations
	for his pilgrimage.</p>

	<p>In the mean time St. Bernard passed into Germany, where similar
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"></a>success attended his preaching. The renown of his sanctity had gone
	before him, and he found every where an admiring audience. Thousands
	of people, who could not understand a word he said,
	flocked around him to catch a glimpse of so holy a man;
	and the knights enrolled themselves in great numbers in the
	service of the cross, each receiving from his hands the symbol
	of the cause. But the people were not led away as in
	the days of Gottschalk. We do not find that they rose in
	such tremendous masses of two and three hundred thousand
	men, swarming over the country like a plague of locusts.
	Still the enthusiasm was very great. The extraordinary
	tales that were told and believed of the miracles worked by
	the preacher brought the country people from far and near.
	Devils were said to vanish at his sight, and diseases of the
	most malignant nature to be cured by his touch.<a href="#fn11" id="fnm11" title="Philip, Archdeacon of the cathedral..." class="fnmarker">11</a> The
	Emperor Conrad caught at last the contagion from his subjects,
	and declared his intention to follow the cross.</p>

	<p>The preparations were carried on so vigorously under the
	orders of Conrad, that in less than three months he found
	himself at the head of an army containing at least one hundred
	and fifty thousand effective men, besides a great number
	of women who followed their husbands and lovers to the
	war. One troop of them rode in the attitude and armour of
	men: their chief wore gilt spurs and buskins, and thence
	acquired the epithet of the golden-footed lady. Conrad was
	ready to set out long before the French monarch, and in
	the month of June 1147, he arrived before Constantinople,
	having passed through Hungary and Bulgaria without offence
	to the inhabitants.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Manuel Comnenus, the Greek emperor, successor not only to the
	throne but to the policy of Alexius, looked with alarm upon the new
	levies who had come to eat up his capital and imperil its tranquillity.
	Too weak to refuse them a passage through his dominions, too distrustful
	of them to make them welcome when they came, and too
	little assured of the advantages likely to result to himself from the
	war, to feign a friendship which he did not feel, the Greek emperor
	gave offence at the very outset. His subjects, in the pride of superior
	civilisation, called the Germans barbarians; while the latter, who, if
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"></a>semi-barbarous, were at least honest and straightforward, retorted
	upon the Greeks by calling them double-faced knaves and traitors.
	Disputes continually arose between them, and Conrad, who had preserved
	so much good order among his followers during their passage,
	was unable to restrain their indignation when they arrived at Constantinople.
	For some offence or other which the Greeks had given
	them, but which is rather hinted at than stated by the scanty historians
	of the day, the Germans broke into the magnificent pleasure-garden
	of the emperor, where he had a valuable collection of tame
	animals, for which the grounds had been laid out in woods, caverns,
	groves, and streams, that each might follow in captivity his natural
	habits. The enraged Germans, meriting the name of barbarians that
	had been bestowed upon them, laid waste this pleasant retreat, and
	killed or let loose the valuable animals it contained. Manuel, who
	is said to have beheld the devastation from his palace windows without
	power or courage to prevent it, was completely disgusted with his
	guests, and resolved, like his predecessor Alexius, to get rid of them
	on the first opportunity. He sent a message to Conrad respectfully
	desiring an interview, but the German refused to trust himself within
	the walls of Constantinople. The Greek emperor, on his part, thought
	it compatible neither with his dignity nor his safety to seek the German,
	and several days were spent in insincere negotiations. Manuel
	at length agreed to furnish the crusading army with guides to conduct
	it through Asia Minor; and Conrad passed over the Hellespont
	with his forces, the advanced guard being commanded by himself,
	and the rear by the warlike Bishop of Freysinghen.</p>

	<p>Historians are almost unanimous in their belief that the wily
	Greek gave instructions to his guides to lead the army of the German
	emperor into dangers and difficulties. It is certain that, instead of
	guiding them through such districts of Asia Minor as afforded water
	and provisions, they led them into the wilds of Cappadocia, where
	neither was to be procured, and where they were suddenly attacked
	by the sultan of the Seljukian Turks, at the head of an immense
	force. The guides, whose treachery is apparent from this fact alone,
	fled at the first sight of the Turkish army, and the Christians were
	left to wage unequal warfare with their enemy, entangled and bewildered
	in desert wilds. Toiling in their heavy mail, the Germans
	could make but little effective resistance to the attacks of the Turkish
	light horse, who were down upon them one instant, and out of sight
	the next. Now in the front and now in the rear, the agile foe showered
	his arrows upon them, enticing them into swamps and hollows, from
	which they could only extricate themselves after long struggles and
	great losses. The Germans, confounded by this mode of warfare, lost
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"></a>all conception of the direction they were pursuing, and went back
	instead of forward. Suffering at the same time for want of provisions,
	they fell an easy prey to their pursuers. Count Bernhard, one of the
	bravest leaders of the German expedition, was surrounded, with his
	whole division, not one of whom escaped the Turkish arrows. The
	emperor himself had nearly fallen a victim, and was twice severely
	wounded. So persevering was the enemy, and so little able were the
	Germans to make even a shew of resistance, that when Conrad at last
	reached the city of Nice, he found that, instead of being at the head
	of an imposing force of one hundred thousand foot and seventy thousand
	horse, he had but fifty or sixty thousand men, and these in the
	most worn and wearied condition.</p>

	<p>Totally ignorant of the treachery of the Greek emperor, although
	he had been warned to beware of it, Louis VII. proceeded, at the
	head of his army, through Worms and Ratisbon, towards Constantinople.
	At Ratisbon he was met by a deputation from Manuel, bearing
	letters so full of hyperbole and flattery, that Louis is reported to
	have blushed when they were read to him by the Bishop of Langres.
	The object of the deputation was to obtain from the French king a
	promise to pass through the Grecian territories in a peaceable and
	friendly manner, and to yield to the Greek emperor any conquest he
	might make in Asia Minor. The first part of the proposition was
	immediately acceded to, but no notice was taken of the second and
	more unreasonable. Louis marched on, and, passing through Hungary,
	pitched his tents in the outskirts of Constantinople.</p>

	<p>On his arrival, Manuel sent him a friendly invitation to enter the
	city at the head of a small train. Louis at once accepted it, and was
	met by the emperor at the porch of his palace. The fairest promises
	were made; every art that flattery could suggest was resorted to, and
	every argument employed, to induce him to yield his future conquests
	to the Greek. Louis obstinately refused to pledge himself, and returned
	to his army convinced that the emperor was a man not to be
	trusted. Negotiations were, however, continued for several days, to
	the great dissatisfaction of the French army. The news that arrived
	of a treaty entered into between Manuel and the Turkish sultan
	changed their dissatisfaction into fury, and the leaders demanded to
	be led against Constantinople, swearing that they would raze the
	treacherous city to the ground. Louis did not feel inclined to accede
	to this proposal, and, breaking up his camp, he crossed over into Asia.</p>

	<p>Here he heard, for the first time, of the mishaps of the German
	emperor, whom he found in a woful plight under the walls of Nice.
	The two monarchs united their forces, and marched together along
	the sea-coast to Ephesus; but Conrad, jealous, it would appear, of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"></a>superior numbers of the French, and not liking to sink into a vassal,
	for the time being, of his rival, withdrew abruptly with the remnant
	of his legions, and returned to Constantinople. Manuel was all
	smiles and courtesy. He condoled with the German so feelingly
	upon his losses, and cursed the stupidity or treachery of the guides
	with such apparent heartiness, that Conrad was half inclined to believe
	in his sincerity.</p>

	<p>Louis, marching onward in the direction of Jerusalem, came up
	with the enemy on the banks of the Meander. The Turks contested
	the passage of the river, but the French bribed a peasant to point out
	a ford lower down: crossing the river without difficulty, they attacked
	the Turks with much vigour, and put them to flight. Whether
	the Turks were really defeated, or merely pretended to be so, is
	doubtful; but the latter supposition seems to be the true one. It
	is probable that it was part of a concerted plan to draw the invaders
	onwards to more unfavourable ground, where their destruction might
	be more certain. If such were the scheme, it succeeded to the heart’s
	wish of its projectors. The Crusaders, on the third day after their
	victory, arrived at a steep mountain-pass, on the summit of which
	the Turkish host lay concealed so artfully, that not the slightest vestige
	of their presence could be perceived. “With labouring steps
	and slow,” they toiled up the steep ascent, when suddenly a tremendous
	fragment of rock came bounding down the precipices with an
	awful crash, bearing dismay and death before it. At the same instant
	the Turkish archers started from their hiding-places, and discharged
	a shower of arrows upon the foot-soldiers, who fell by hundreds at a
	time. The arrows rebounded harmlessly against the iron mail of the
	knights, which the Turks observing, took aim at their steeds, and
	horse and rider fell down the steep into the rapid torrent which
	rushed below. Louis, who commanded the rear-guard, received the
	first intimation of the onslaught from the sight of the wounded and
	flying soldiers, and, not knowing the numbers of the enemy, he
	pushed vigorously forward to stay, by his presence, the panic which
	had taken possession of his army. All his efforts were in vain. Immense
	stones continued to be hurled upon them as they advanced,
	bearing men and horse before them; and those who succeeded in
	forcing their way to the top were met hand-to-hand by the Turks,
	and cast down headlong upon their companions. Louis himself
	fought with the energy of desperation, but had great difficulty to
	avoid falling into the enemy’s hands. He escaped at last under cover
	of the night, with the remnant of his forces, and took up his position
	before Attalia. Here he restored the discipline and the courage of
	his disorganised and disheartened followers, and debated with his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"></a>captains the plan that was to be pursued. After suffering severely
	both from disease and famine, it was resolved that they should
	march to Antioch, which still remained an independent principality
	under the successors of Bohemund of Tarentum. At this time the
	sovereignty was vested in the person of Raymond, the uncle of Eleanor
	of Aquitaine. This prince, presuming upon his relationship to the
	French queen, endeavoured to withdraw Louis from the grand object
	of the Crusade—the defence of the kingdom of Jerusalem, and secure
	his co-operation in extending the limits and the power of his principality
	of Antioch. The Prince of Tripoli formed a similar design;
	but Louis rejected the offers of both, and marched, after a short
	delay, to Jerusalem. The Emperor Conrad was there before him,
	having left Constantinople with promises of assistance from Manuel
	Comnenus—assistance which never arrived, and was never intended.</p>

		<p class="caption">DAMASCUS.</p>
	</div>

	<p>A great council of the Christian princes of Palestine, and the
	leaders of the Crusade, was then summoned, to discuss the future
	operations of the war. It was ultimately determined that it would
	further the cause of the cross in a greater degree if the united armies,
	instead of proceeding to Edessa, laid siege to the city of Damascus,
	and drove the Saracens from that strong position. This was a bold
	scheme, and, had it been boldly followed out, would have insured,
	in all probability, the success of the war. But the Christian leaders
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>never learned from experience the necessity of union, that very soul
	of great enterprises. Though they all agreed upon the policy of the
	plan, yet every one had his own notions as to the means of executing
	it. The princes of Antioch and Tripoli were jealous of each other,
	and of the king of Jerusalem. The Emperor Conrad was jealous of
	the king of France, and the king of France was disgusted with them
	all. But he had come out to Palestine in accordance with a solemn
	vow; his religion, though it may be called bigotry, was sincere; and
	he determined to remain to the very last moment that a chance was
	left of effecting any good for the cause he had set his heart on.</p>

	<p>The siege of Damascus was accordingly commenced, and with so
	much ability and vigour that the Christians gained a considerable
	advantage at the very outset. For weeks the siege was pressed, till
	the shattered fortifications and diminishing resistance of the besieged
	gave evidence that the city could not hold out much longer. At that
	moment the insane jealousy of the leaders led to dissensions that
	soon caused the utter failure, not only of the siege but of the Crusade.
	A modern cookery-book, in giving a recipe for cooking a hare,
	says, “first catch your hare, and then kill it”—a maxim of indisputable
	wisdom. The Christian chiefs, on this occasion, had not so
	much sagacity, for they began a violent dispute among themselves
	for the possession of a city which was still unconquered. There being
	already a prince of Antioch and a prince of Tripoli, twenty claimants
	started for the principality of Damascus; and a grand council of the
	leaders was held to determine the individual on whom the honour
	should devolve. Many valuable days were wasted in this discussion,
	the enemy in the meanwhile gaining strength from their inactivity.
	It was at length, after a stormy deliberation, agreed that Count Robert
	of Flanders, who had twice visited the Holy Land, should be
	invested with the dignity. The other claimants refused to recognise
	him or to co-operate in the siege until a more equitable arrangement
	had been made. Suspicion filled the camp; the most sinister
	rumours of intrigues and treachery were set afloat; and the discontented
	candidates withdrew at last to the other side of the city, and
	commenced operations on their own account without a probability of
	success. They were soon joined by the rest of the army. The consequence
	was that the weakest side of the city, and that on which
	they had already made considerable progress in the work of demolition,
	was left uncovered. The enemy was prompt to profit by the
	mistake, and received an abundant supply of provisions, and refortified
	the walls, before the Crusaders came to their senses again. When
	this desirable event happened, it was too late. Saph Eddin, the
	powerful emir of Mousoul, was in the neighbourhood, at the head of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>a large army, advancing by forced marches to the relief of the city.
	The siege was abruptly abandoned, and the foolish Crusaders returned
	to Jerusalem, having done nothing to weaken the enemy, but every
	thing to weaken themselves.</p>

	<p>The freshness of enthusiasm had now completely subsided; even
	the meanest soldiers were sick at heart. Conrad, from whose fierce
	zeal at the outset so much might have been expected, was wearied
	with reverses, and returned to Europe with the poor remnant of his
	host. Louis lingered a short time longer, for very shame, but the
	pressing solicitations of his minister Suger induced him to return to
	France. Thus ended the second Crusade. Its history is but a chronicle
	of defeats. It left the kingdom of Jerusalem in a worse state
	than when it quitted Europe, and gained nothing but disgrace for its
	leaders, and discouragement for all concerned.</p>

	<p>St. Bernard, who had prophesied a result so different, fell after
	this into some disrepute, and experienced, like many other prophets,
	the fate of being without honour in his own country. What made
	the matter worse, he could not obtain it in any other. Still, however,
	there were not wanting zealous advocates to stand forward in
	his behalf, and stem the tide of incredulity, which, unopposed, would
	have carried away his reputation. The Bishop of Freysinghen declared
	that prophets were not always able to prophesy, and that the
	vices of the Crusaders drew down the wrath of heaven upon them.
	But the most ingenious excuse ever made for St. Bernard is to be
	found in his life by Geoffroi de Clairvaux, where he pertinaciously insists
	that the Crusade was not unfortunate. St. Bernard, he says, had
	prophesied a happy result, and that result could not be considered
	other than happy which had peopled heaven with so glorious an army
	of martyrs. Geoffroi was a cunning pleader, and, no doubt, convinced
	a few of the zealous; but plain people, who were not wanting even
	in those days, retained their own opinion, or, what amounts to the
	same thing, “were convinced against their will.”</p>

	<p>We now come to the consideration of the third Crusade, and of
	the causes which rendered it necessary. The epidemic frenzy, which
	had been cooling ever since the issue of the first expedition, was now
	extinct, or very nearly so, and the nations of Europe looked with
	cold indifference upon the armaments of their princes. But chivalry
	had flourished in its natural element of war, and was now in all its
	glory. It continued to supply armies for the Holy Land when the
	popular ranks refused to deliver up their able-bodied swarms. Poetry,
	which, more than religion, inspired the third Crusade, was then but
	“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caviare</em> to the million,” who had other matters, of sterner import,
	to claim all their attention. But the knights and their retainers
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"></a>listened with delight to the martial and amatory strains of the minstrels,
	minnesängers, trouvères, and troubadours, and burned to win favour
	in ladies’ eyes by shewing prowess in the Holy Land. The third was
	truly the romantic era of the Crusades. Men fought then, not so
	much for the sepulchre of Jesus, and the maintenance of a Christian
	kingdom in the East, as to gain glory for themselves in the best and
	almost only field where glory could be obtained. They fought, not
	as zealots, but as soldiers; not for religion, but for honour; not for
	the crown of martyrdom, but for the favour of the lovely.</p>

	<p>It is not necessary to enter into a detail of the events by which
	Saladin attained the sovereignty of the East, or how, after a succession
	of engagements, he planted the Moslem banner once more upon
	the battlements of Jerusalem. The Christian knights and population,
	including the grand orders of St. John, the Hospitallers, and
	the Templars, were sunk in an abyss of vice, and, torn by unworthy
	jealousies and dissensions, were unable to resist the well-trained
	armies which the wise and mighty Saladin brought forward to crush
	them. But the news of their fall created a painful sensation among
	the chivalry of Europe, whose noblest members were linked to the
	dwellers in Palestine by many ties, both of blood and friendship.
	The news of the great battle of Tiberias, in which Saladin defeated
	the Christian host with terrible slaughter, arrived first in Europe,
	and was followed in quick succession by that of the capture of Jerusalem,
	Antioch, Tripoli, and other cities. Dismay seized upon the
	clergy. The Pope (Urban III.)
	was so affected by the news that
	he pined away for grief, and was
	scarcely seen to smile again, until
	he sank into the sleep of death.<a href="#fn12" id="fnm12" title="James of Vitry..." class="fnmarker">12</a>
	His successor, Gregory VIII., felt
	the loss as acutely, but had better
	strength to bear it, and instructed
	all the clergy of the Christian
	world to stir up the people to
	arms for the recovery of the Holy
	Sepulchre. William Archbishop
	of Tyre, a humble follower in the
	path of Peter the Hermit, left Palestine
	to preach to the kings of
	Europe the miseries he had witnessed,
	and to incite them to the rescue. The renowned Frederick
	Barbarossa, the emperor of Germany, speedily collected an army, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"></a>passing over into Syria with less delay than had ever before awaited
	a crusading force, defeated the Saracens, and took possession of the
	city of Iconium. He was unfortunately cut off in the middle of his
	successful career, by imprudently bathing in the Cydnus<a href="#fn13" id="fnm13" title="The desire of comparing..." class="fnmarker">13</a> while he
	was overheated, and the Duke of Suabia took the command of the
	expedition. The latter did not prove so able a general, and met
	with nothing but reverses, although he was enabled to maintain a
	footing at Antioch until assistance arrived from Europe.</p>

		<p class="caption">HENRY II. OF ENGLAND.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Henry II. of England and Philip Augustus of France, at the head
	of their chivalry, supported the Crusade with all their influence, until
	wars and dissensions nearer home estranged them from it for a time.
	The two kings met at Gisors in Normandy in the month of January,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"></a>1188, accompanied by a brilliant train of knights and warriors. William
	of Tyre was present, and expounded the cause of the cross with
	considerable eloquence, and the whole assembly bound themselves by
	oath to proceed to Jerusalem. It was agreed at the same time that
	a tax, called Saladin’s tithe, and consisting of the tenth part of all
	possessions, whether landed or personal, should be enforced over
	Christendom, upon every one who was either unable or unwilling to
	assume the cross. The lord of every feof, whether lay or ecclesiastical,
	was charged to raise the tithe within his own jurisdiction; and any
	one who refused to pay his quota, became by that act the bondsman
	and absolute property of his lord. At the same time the greatest indulgence
	was shewn to those who assumed the cross; no man was at
	liberty to stay them by process of any kind, whether for debt, or
	robbery, or murder. The king of Prance, at the breaking up of the
	conference, summoned a parliament at Paris, where these resolutions
	were solemnly confirmed, while Henry II. did the same for his
	Norman possessions at Rouen, and for England at Geddington, in
	Northamptonshire. To use the words of an ancient chronicler,<a href="#fn14" id="fnm14" title="Stowe." class="fnmarker">14</a> “he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"></a>held a parliament about the voyage into the Holy Land, and troubled
	the whole land with the paying of tithes towards it.”</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:276px;">

		<p class="caption">PHILIP AUGUSTUS.</p>
	</div>

	<p>But it was not England alone
	that was “<em>troubled</em>” by the tax.
	The people of France also looked upon
	it with no pleasant feelings, and
	appear from that time forth to have
	changed their indifference for the
	Crusade into aversion. Even the
	clergy, who were exceedingly willing
	that other people should contribute
	half, or even all their goods in furtherance
	of their favourite scheme,
	were not at all anxious to contribute
	a single sous themselves. Millot[15]<a href="#fn15" id="fnm15" title="Elémens de l'Histoire de France." class="fnmarker">15</a> relates
	that several of them cried out
	against the impost. Among the rest,
	the clergy of Rheims were called upon
	to pay their quota, but sent a
	deputation to the king, begging him
	to be contented with the aid of their
	prayers, as they were too poor to contribute
	in any other shape. Philip
	Augustus knew better, and by way
	of giving them a lesson, employed
	three nobles of the vicinity to lay
	waste the Church lands. The clergy,
	informed of the outrage, applied to the king for redress. “I will
	aid you with my prayers,” said the monarch condescendingly, “and
	will entreat those gentlemen to let the Church alone.” He did
	as he had promised, but in such a manner that the nobles, who
	appreciated the joke, continued their devastations as before. Again
	the clergy applied to the king. “What would you have of me?”
	he replied, in answer to their remonstrances: “you gave me your
	prayers in my necessity, and I have given you mine in yours.” The
	clergy understood the argument, and thought it the wiser course to
	pay their quota of Saladin’s tithe without further parley.</p>

	<p>This anecdote shews the unpopularity of the Crusade. If the
	clergy disliked to contribute, it is no wonder that the people felt still
	greater antipathy. But the chivalry of Europe was eager for the
	affray: the tithe was rigorously collected, and armies from England,
	France, Burgundy, Italy, Flanders, and Germany, were soon in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"></a>field. The two kings who were to have led it were, however, drawn
	into broils by an aggression of Richard duke of Guienne, better known
	as Richard Cœur de Lion, upon the territory of the Count of Toulouse,
	and the proposed journey to Palestine was delayed. War continued
	to rage between France and England, and with so little probability
	of a speedy termination, that many of the nobles, bound to the Crusade,
	left the two monarchs to settle the differences at their leisure,
	and proceeded to Palestine without them.</p>

	<p>Death at last stepped in and removed Henry II. from the hostility
	of his foes, and the treachery and ingratitude of his children. His
	son Richard immediately concluded an alliance with Philip Augustus;
	and the two young, valiant, and impetuous monarchs united
	all their energies to forward the Crusade. They met with a numerous
	and brilliant retinue at Nonancourt in Normandy, where, in
	sight of their assembled chivalry, they embraced as brothers, and
	swore to live as friends and true allies, until a period of forty days
	after their return from the Holy Land. With a view of purging
	their camp from the follies and vices which had proved so ruinous
	to preceding expeditions, they drew up a code of laws for the government
	of the army. Gambling had been carried to a great extent,
	and proved the fruitful source of quarrels and bloodshed; and one of
	their laws prohibited any person in the army, beneath the degree of
	a knight, from playing at any game for money.<a href="#fn16" id="fnm16" title="Strutt’s Sports and Pastimes." class="fnmarker">16</a> Knights and clergymen
	might play for money, but no one was permitted to lose or gain
	more than twenty shillings in a day, under a penalty of one hundred
	shillings. The personal attendants of the monarchs were also allowed
	to play to the same extent. The penalty in their case for infraction
	was that they should be whipped naked through the army
	for the space of three days. Any Crusader, who struck another and
	drew blood, was ordered to have his hand cut off; and whoever slew
	a brother Crusader was condemned to be tied alive to the corpse of
	his victim, and buried with him. No young women were allowed to
	follow the army, to the great sorrow of many vicious and of many virtuous
	dames, who had not courage to elude the decree by dressing in
	male attire. But many high-minded and affectionate maidens and
	matrons, bearing the sword or the spear, followed their husbands
	and lovers to the war in spite of King Richard, and in defiance of
	danger. The only women allowed to accompany the army in their
	own habiliments were washerwomen of fifty years complete, and any
	others of the fair sex who had reached the same age.</p>

	<p>These rules having been promulgated, the two monarchs marched
	together to Lyons, where they separated, agreeing to meet again at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"></a>Messina. Philip proceeded across the Alps to Genoa, where he took
	ship, and was conveyed in safety to the place of rendezvous. Richard
	turned in the direction of Marseilles, where he also took ship for
	Messina. His impetuous disposition hurried him into many squabbles
	by the way, and his knights and followers, for the most part
	as brave and as foolish as himself, imitated him very zealously in this
	particular. At Messina the Sicilians charged the most exorbitant
	prices for every necessary of life. Richard’s army in vain remonstrated.
	From words they came to blows, and, as a last resource, plundered
	the Sicilians, since they could not trade with them. Continual
	battles were the consequence, in one of which Lebrun, the favourite
	attendant of Richard, lost his life. The peasantry from far and near
	came flocking to the aid of the townspeople, and the battle soon became
	general. Richard, irritated at the loss of his favourite, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"></a>incited by report that Tancred, the king of Sicily, was fighting at the
	head of his own people, joined the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</em> with his boldest knights,
	and, beating back the Sicilians, attacked the city sword in hand,
	stormed the battlements, tore down the flag of Sicily, and planted
	his own in its stead. This collision gave great offence to the king
	of France, who became from that time jealous of Richard, and apprehensive
	that his design was not so much to re-establish the Christian
	kingdom of Jerusalem, as to make conquests for himself. He,
	however, exerted his influence to restore peace between the English
	and Sicilians, and shortly afterwards set sail for Acre, with distrust of
	his ally germinating in his heart.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:190px;">

		<p class="caption">THE ISLAND OF RHODES.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Richard remained behind for some weeks in a state of inactivity
	quite unaccountable in one of his temperament. He appears to have
	had no more squabbles with the Sicilians, but to have lived an easy,
	luxurious life, forgetting, in the lap of pleasure, the objects for which
	he had quitted his own dominions and the dangerous laxity he was
	introducing into his army. The superstition of his soldiers recalled
	him at length to a sense of his duty: a comet was seen for several
	successive nights, which was thought to menace them with the vengeance
	of Heaven for their delay. Shooting stars gave them similar
	warning; and a fanatic, of the name of Joachim, with his drawn
	sword in his hand, and his long hair streaming wildly over his shoulders,
	went through the camp, howling all night long, and predicting
	plague, famine, and every other calamity, if they did not set out immediately.
	Richard did not deem it prudent to neglect the intimations;
	and, after doing humble penance for his remissness, he set sail
	for Acre.</p>

	<p>A violent storm dispersed his fleet, but he arrived safely at Rhodes
	with the principal part of the armament. Here he learned that three
	of his ships had been stranded on the rocky coasts of Cyprus, and that
	the ruler of the island, Isaac Comnenus, had permitted his people to
	pillage the unfortunate crews, and had refused shelter to his betrothed
	bride, the Princess Berengaria, and his sister, who, in one of the vessels,
	had been driven by stress of weather into the port of Limisso.
	The fiery monarch swore to be revenged, and, collecting all his vessels,
	sailed back to Limisso. Isaac Comnenus refused to apologise or explain,
	and Richard, in no mood to be trifled with, landed on the
	island, routed with great loss the forces sent to oppose him, and laid
	the whole country under contribution.</p>

		<p class="caption">RICHARD I. AND BERENGARIA.</p>
	</div>

	<p>On his arrival at Acre he found the whole of the chivalry of Europe
	there before him. Guy of Lusignan, the king of Jerusalem,
	had long before collected the bold Knights of the Temple, the Hospital,
	and St. John, and had laid siege to Acre, which was resolutely
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"></a>defended by the Sultan Saladin, with an army magnificent both for
	its numbers and its discipline. For nearly two years the Crusaders
	had pushed the siege, and made efforts almost superhuman to dislodge
	the enemy. Various battles had taken place in the open fields
	with no decisive advantage to either party, and Guy of Lusignan had
	begun to despair of taking that strong position without aid from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"></a>Europe. His joy was extreme on the arrival of Philip with all his
	chivalry, and he only awaited the coming of Cœur de Lion to make
	one last decisive attack upon the town. When the fleet of England
	was first seen approaching the shores of Syria, a universal shout
	arose from the Christian camp; and when Richard landed with his
	train, one louder still pierced to the very mountains of the south,
	where Saladin lay with all his army.</p>

	<p>It may be remarked as characteristic of this Crusade, that the
	Christians and the Moslems no longer looked upon each other as barbarians,
	to whom mercy was a crime. Each host entertained the
	highest admiration for the bravery and magnanimity of the other,
	and, in their occasional truces, met upon the most friendly terms.
	The Moslem warriors were full of courtesy to the Christian knights,
	and had no other regret than to think that such fine fellows were not
	Mahomedans. The Christians, with a feeling precisely similar, extolled
	to the skies the nobleness of the Saracens, and sighed to think
	that such generosity and valour should be sullied by disbelief in the
	Gospel of Jesus. But when the strife began, all these feelings disappeared,
	and the struggle became mortal.</p>

	<p>The jealousy excited in the mind of Philip by the events of Messina
	still rankled, and the two monarchs refused to act in concert.
	Instead of making a joint attack upon the town, the French monarch
	assailed it alone, and was repulsed. Richard did the same, and with
	the same result. Philip tried to seduce the soldiers of Richard from
	their allegiance by the offer of three gold pieces per month to every
	knight who would forsake the banners of England for those of France.
	Richard endeavoured to neutralise the offer by a larger one, and promised
	four pieces to every French knight who should join the Lion of
	England. In this unworthy rivalry their time was wasted, to the great
	detriment of the discipline and efficiency of their followers. Some good
	was nevertheless effected; for the mere presence of two such armies
	prevented the besieged city from receiving supplies, and the inhabitants
	were reduced by famine to the most woful straits. Saladin did
	not deem it prudent to risk a general engagement by coming to their
	relief, but preferred to wait till dissension had weakened his enemy,
	and made him an easy prey. Perhaps if he had been aware of the
	real extent of the extremity in Acre, he would have changed his
	plan; but, cut off from the town, he did not know its misery till it
	was too late. After a short truce the city capitulated upon terms so
	severe that Saladin afterwards refused to ratify them. The chief conditions
	were, that the precious wood of the true cross, captured by
	the Moslems in Jerusalem, should be restored; that a sum of two
	hundred thousand gold pieces should be paid; and that all the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"></a>Christian prisoners in Acre should be released, together with two hundred
	knights and a thousand soldiers detained in captivity by Saladin.
	The eastern monarch, as may be well conceived, did not set much store
	on the wood of the cross, but was nevertheless anxious to keep it, as
	he knew its possession by the Christians would do more than a victory
	to restore their courage. He refused, therefore, to deliver it up,
	or to accede to any of the conditions; and Richard, as he had previously
	threatened, barbarously ordered all the Saracen prisoners in
	his power to be put to death.</p>

	<p>The possession of the city only caused new and unhappy dissensions
	between the Christian leaders. The Archduke of Austria unjustifiably
	hoisted his flag on one of the towers of Acre, which
	Richard no sooner saw than he tore it down with his own hands, and
	trampled it under his feet. Philip, though he did not sympathise
	with the archduke, was piqued at the assumption of Richard, and
	the breach between the two monarchs became wider than ever. A
	foolish dispute arose at the same time between Guy of Lusignan and
	Conrad of Montferrat for the crown of Jerusalem. The inferior
	knights were not slow to imitate the pernicious example, and jealousy,
	distrust, and ill-will reigned in the Christian camp. In the
	midst of this confusion the king of France suddenly announced his
	intention to return to his own country. Richard was filled with
	indignation, and exclaimed, “Eternal shame light on him, and on
	all France, if, for any cause, he leave this work unfinished!” But
	Philip was not to be stayed. His health had suffered by his residence
	in the East; and, ambitious of playing a first part, he preferred to
	play none at all than to play second to King Richard. Leaving a
	small detachment of Burgundians behind, he returned to France
	with the remainder of his army; and Cœur de Lion, without feeling,
	in the multitude of his rivals, that he had lost the greatest, became
	painfully convinced that the right arm of the enterprise was
	lopped off.</p>

	<p>After his departure, Richard re-fortified Acre, restored the Christian
	worship in the churches, and, leaving a Christian garrison to
	protect it, marched along the sea-coast towards Ascalon. Saladin
	was on the alert, and sent his light horse to attack the rear of the
	Christian army, while he himself, miscalculating their weakness since
	the defection of Philip, endeavoured to force them to a general engagement.
	The rival armies met near Azotus. A fierce battle ensued,
	in which Saladin was defeated and put to flight, and the road to Jerusalem
	left free for the Crusaders.</p>

	<p>Again discord exerted its baleful influence, and prevented Richard
	from following up his victory. His opinion was constantly opposed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"></a>by the other leaders, all jealous of his bravery and influence; and the
	army, instead of marching to Jerusalem, or even to Ascalon, as was
	first intended, proceeded to Jaffa, and remained in idleness until
	Saladin was again in a condition to wage war against them.</p>

		<p class="caption">BETHLEHEM.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Many months were spent in fruitless hostilities and as fruitless
	negotiations. Richard’s wish was to recapture Jerusalem; but there
	were difficulties in the way, which even his bold spirit could not conquer.
	His own intolerable pride was not the least cause of the evil;
	for it estranged many a generous spirit, who would have been willing
	to co-operate with him in all cordiality. At length it was agreed to
	march to the Holy City; but the progress made was so slow and painful,
	that the soldiers murmured, and the leaders meditated retreat.
	The weather was hot and dry, and there was little water to be procured.
	Saladin had choked up the wells and cisterns on the route,
	and the army had not zeal enough to push forward amid such privation.
	At Bethlehem a council was held, to debate whether they
	should retreat or advance. Retreat was decided upon, and immediately
	commenced. It is said, that Richard was first led to a hill,
	whence he could obtain a sight of the towers of Jerusalem, and that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"></a>he was so affected at being so near it, and so unable to relieve it, that
	he hid his face behind his shield, and sobbed aloud.</p>

	<p>The army separated into two divisions, the smaller falling back
	upon Jaffa, and the larger, commanded by Richard and the Duke of
	Burgundy, returning to Acre. Before the English monarch had made
	all his preparations for his return to Europe, a messenger reached
	Acre with the intelligence that Jaffa was besieged by Saladin, and
	that, unless relieved immediately, the city would be taken. The
	French, under the Duke of Burgundy, were so wearied with the war,
	that they refused to aid their brethren in Jaffa. Richard, blushing
	with shame at their pusillanimity, called his English to the rescue,
	and arrived just in time to save the city. His very name put the
	Saracens to flight, so great was their dread of his prowess. Saladin
	regarded him with the warmest admiration, and when Richard, after
	his victory, demanded peace, willingly acceded. A truce was concluded
	for three years and eight months, during which Christian pilgrims
	were to enjoy the liberty of visiting Jerusalem without hindrance
	or payment of any tax. The Crusaders were allowed to retain
	the cities of Tyre and Jaffa, with the country intervening. Saladin,
	with a princely generosity, invited many of the Christians to visit
	Jerusalem; and several of the leaders took advantage of his offer to
	feast their eyes upon a spot which all considered so sacred. Many of
	them were entertained for days in the sultan’s own palace, from which
	they returned with their tongues laden with the praises of the noble
	infidel. Richard and Saladin never met, though the impression that
	they did will remain on many minds, who have been dazzled by the
	glorious fiction of Sir Walter Scott. But each admired the prowess
	and nobleness of soul of his rival, and agreed to terms far less onerous
	than either would have accepted, had this mutual admiration not
	existed.<a href="#fn17" id="fnm17" title="Richard left a high reputation..." class="fnmarker">17</a></p>

	<p>The king of England no longer delayed his departure, for messengers
	from his own country brought imperative news that his presence
	was required to defeat the intrigues that were fomenting against
	his crown. His long imprisonment in the Austrian dominions and
	final ransom are too well known to be dwelt upon. And thus ended
	the third Crusade, less destructive of human life than the two first,
	but quite as useless.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"></a>The flame of popular enthusiasm now burned pale indeed, and all
	the efforts of popes and potentates were insufficient to rekindle it.
	At last, after flickering unsteadily, like a lamp expiring in the socket,
	it burned up brightly for one final instant, and was extinguished for
	ever.</p>

	<p>The fourth Crusade, as connected with popular feeling, requires
	little or no notice. At the death of Saladin, which happened a year
	after the conclusion of his truce with Richard of England, his vast
	empire fell to pieces. His brother Saif Eddin, or Saphaddin, seized
	upon Syria, in the possession of which he was troubled by the sons of
	Saladin. When this intelligence reached Europe, the Pope, Celestine
	III., judged the moment favourable for preaching a new Crusade.
	But every nation in Europe was unwilling and cold towards it. The
	people had no ardour, and kings were occupied with more weighty
	matters at home. The only monarch of Europe who encouraged it
	was the Emperor Henry of Germany, under whose auspices the Dukes
	of Saxony and Bavaria took the field at the head of a considerable
	force. They landed in Palestine, and found any thing but a welcome
	from the Christian inhabitants. Under the mild sway of Saladin,
	they had enjoyed repose and toleration, and both were endangered by
	the arrival of the Germans. They looked upon them in consequence
	as over-officious intruders, and gave them no encouragement in the
	warfare against Saphaddin. The result of this Crusade was even
	more disastrous than the last; for the Germans contrived not only to
	embitter the Saracens against the Christians of Judea, but to lose the
	strong city of Jaffa, and cause the destruction of nine-tenths of the
	army with which they had quitted Europe. And so ended the fourth
	Crusade.</p>

	<p>The fifth was more important, and had a result which its projectors
	never dreamed of—no less than the sacking of Constantinople,
	and the placing of a French dynasty upon the imperial throne of the
	eastern Cæsars. Each succeeding pope, however much he may have
	differed from his predecessors on other points, zealously agreed in
	one, that of maintaining by every possible means the papal ascendency.
	No scheme was so likely to aid in this endeavour as the Crusades.
	As long as they could persuade the kings and nobles of Europe
	to fight and die in Syria, their own sway was secured over the minds
	of men at home. Such being their object, they never inquired whether
	a Crusade was or was not likely to be successful, whether the
	time were well or ill chosen, or whether men and money could be
	procured in sufficient abundance. Pope Innocent III. would have
	been proud if he could have bent the refractory monarchs of England
	and France into so much submission. But John and Philip Augustus
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"></a>were both engaged. Both had deeply offended the Church, and had
	been laid under her ban, and both were occupied in important reforms
	at home; Philip in bestowing immunities upon his subjects, and
	John in having them forced from him. The emissaries of the pope
	therefore plied them in vain; but as in the first and second Crusades,
	the eloquence of a powerful preacher incited the nobility, and through
	them a certain portion of the people; Foulque bishop of Neuilly, an
	ambitious and enterprising prelate, entered fully into the views of
	the court of Rome, and preached the Crusade wherever he could find
	an audience. Chance favoured him to a degree he did not himself
	expect, for he had in general found but few proselytes, and those few
	but cold in the cause. Theobald count of Champagne had instituted
	a grand tournament, to which he had invited all the nobles
	from far and near. Upwards of two thousand knights were present
	with their retainers, besides a vast concourse of people to witness the
	sports. In the midst of the festivities Foulque arrived upon the spot,
	and conceiving the opportunity to be a favourable one, he addressed
	the multitude in eloquent language, and passionately called upon
	them to enrol themselves for the new Crusade. The Count de Champagne,
	young, ardent, and easily excited, received the cross at his
	hands. The enthusiasm spread rapidly. Charles count of Blois followed
	the example, and of the two thousand knights present, scarcely
	one hundred and fifty refused. The popular phrensy seemed on the
	point of breaking out as in the days of yore. The Count of Flanders,
	the Count of Bar, the Duke of Burgundy, and the Marquis of Montferrat,
	brought all their vassals to swell the train, and in a very short
	space of time an effective army was on foot and ready to march to
	Palestine.</p>

	<p>The dangers of an overland journey were too well understood,
	and the Crusaders endeavoured to make a contract with some of the
	Italian states to convey them over in their vessels. Dandolo, the
	aged doge of Venice, offered them the galleys of the Republic; but
	the Crusaders, on their arrival in that city, found themselves too poor
	to pay even half the sum demanded. Every means was tried to raise
	money; the Crusaders melted down their plate, and ladies gave up
	their trinkets. Contributions were solicited from the faithful, but
	came in so slowly as to make it evident to all concerned, that the
	faithful of Europe were outnumbered by the prudent. As a last resource,
	Dandolo offered to convey them to Palestine at the expense
	of the Republic, if they would previously aid in the recapture of
	the city of Zara, which had been seized from the Venetians a short
	time previously by the king of Hungary. The Crusaders consented,
	much to the displeasure of the pope, who threatened excommunication
	<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"></a>upon all who should be turned aside from the voyage to Jerusalem.
	But notwithstanding the fulminations of the Church, the expedition
	never reached Palestine. The siege of Zara was speedily
	undertaken. After a long and brave defence, the city surrendered
	at discretion, and the Crusaders were free, if they had so chosen it,
	to use their swords against the Saracens. But the ambition of the
	chiefs had been directed, by unforeseen circumstances, elsewhere.</p>

	<p>After the death of Manuel Comnenus, the Greek empire had fallen
	a prey to intestine divisions. His son Alexius II. had succeeded him,
	but was murdered after a short reign by his uncle Andronicus, who
	seized upon the throne. His reign also was but of short duration.
	Isaac Angelus, a member of the same family, took up arms against
	the usurper, and having defeated and captured him in a pitched battle,
	had him put to death. He also mounted the throne only to be cast
	down from it. His brother Alexius deposed him, and to incapacitate
	him from reigning, put out his eyes, and shut him up in a dungeon.
	Neither was Alexius III. allowed to remain in peaceable possession
	of the throne; the son of the unhappy Isaac, whose name also was
	Alexius, fled from Constantinople, and hearing that the Crusaders
	had undertaken the siege of Zara, made them the most magnificent
	offers if they would afterwards aid him in deposing his uncle. His
	offers were, that if by their means he was re-established in his father’s
	dominions, he would place the Greek Church under the authority of
	the Pope of Rome, lend the whole force of the Greek empire to the
	conquest of Palestine, and distribute two hundred thousand marks
	of silver among the crusading army. The offer was accepted, with a
	proviso on the part of some of the leaders, that they should be free to
	abandon the design, if it met with the disapproval of the pope. But
	this was not to be feared. The submission of the schismatic Greeks
	to the See of Rome was a greater bribe to the Pontiff than the utter
	annihilation of the Saracen power in Palestine would have been.</p>

	<p>The Crusaders were soon in movement for the imperial city.
	Their operations were skilfully and courageously directed, and spread
	such dismay as to paralyse the efforts of the usurper to retain possession
	of his throne. After a vain resistance, he abandoned the city to
	its fate, and fled no one knew whither. The aged and blind Isaac was
	taken from his dungeon by his subjects, and placed upon the throne
	ere the Crusaders were apprised of the flight of his rival. His son
	Alexius IV. was afterwards associated with him in the sovereignty.</p>

	<p>But the conditions of the treaty gave offence to the Grecian people,
	whose prelates refused to place themselves under the dominion
	of the See of Rome. Alexius at first endeavoured to persuade his
	subjects to admission, and prayed the Crusaders to remain in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"></a>Constantinople until they had fortified him in the possession of a throne
	which was yet far from secure. He soon became unpopular with his
	subjects; and breaking faith with regard to the subsidies, he offended
	the Crusaders. War was at length declared upon him by both parties;
	by his people for his tyranny, and by his former friends for his
	treachery. He was seized in his palace by his own guards and thrown
	into prison, while the Crusaders were making ready to besiege his
	capital. The Greeks immediately proceeded to the election of a new
	monarch; and looking about for a man of courage, energy, and perseverance,
	they fixed upon Alexius Ducas, who, with almost every
	bad quality, was possessed of the virtues they needed. He ascended
	the throne under the name of Murzuphlis. One of his first acts was
	to rid himself of his youngest predecessor—a broken heart had already
	removed the blind old Isaac, no longer a stumbling-block in
	his way—and the young Alexius was soon after put to death in his
	prison.</p>

		<p class="caption">CONSTANTINOPLE.</p>
	</div>


	<p>War to the knife was now declared between the Greeks and the
	Franks; and early in the spring of the year 1204, preparations were
	commenced for an assault upon Constantinople. The French and
	Venetians entered into a treaty for the division of the spoils among
	their soldiery; for so confident were they of success, that failure
	never once entered into their calculations. This confidence led them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"></a>on to victory; while the Greeks, cowardly as treacherous people always
	are, were paralysed by a foreboding of evil. It has been a
	matter of astonishment to all historians, that Murzuphlis, with the
	reputation for courage which he had acquired, and the immense resources
	at his disposal, took no better measures to repel the onset
	of the Crusaders. Their numbers were as a mere handful in comparison
	with those which he could have brought against them; and
	if they had the hopes of plunder to lead them on, the Greeks had
	their homes to fight for, and their very existence as a nation to protect.
	After an impetuous assault, repulsed for one day, but renewed
	with double impetuosity on another, the Crusaders lashed their vessels
	against the walls, slew every man who opposed them, and, with
	little loss to themselves, entered the city. Murzuphlis fled, and Constantinople
	was given over to be pillaged by the victors. The wealth
	they found was enormous. In money alone there was sufficient to
	distribute twenty marks of silver to each knight, ten to each squire
	or servant at arms, and five to each archer. Jewels, velvets, silks,
	and every luxury of attire, with rare wines and fruits, and valuable
	merchandise of every description, also fell into their hands, and were
	bought by the trading Venetians, and the proceeds distributed among
	the army. Two thousand persons were put to the sword; but had
	there been less plunder to take up the attention of the victors, the
	slaughter would in all probability have been much greater.</p>

	<p>In many of the bloody wars which defile the page of history, we
	find that soldiers, utterly reckless of the works of God, will destroy his
	masterpiece, man, with unsparing brutality, but linger with respect
	round the beautiful works of art. They will slaughter women and
	children, but spare a picture; will hew down the sick, the helpless,
	and the hoary-headed, but refrain from injuring a fine piece of sculpture.
	The Latins, on their entrance into Constantinople, respected
	neither the works of God nor man, but vented their brutal ferocity
	upon the one, and satisfied their avarice upon the other. Many beautiful
	bronze statues, above all price as works of art, were broken into
	pieces to be sold as old metal. The finely-chiselled marble, which
	could be put to no such vile uses, was also destroyed with a recklessness,
	if possible, still more atrocious.<a href="#fn18" id="fnm18" title="The following is a list..." class="fnmarker">18</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"></a>The carnage being over, and the spoil distributed, six persons were
	chosen from among the Franks and six from among the Venetians,
	who were to meet and elect an emperor, previously binding themselves
	by oath to select the individual best qualified among the candidates.
	The choice wavered between Baldwin count of Flanders and Boniface
	marquis of Montferrat, but fell eventually upon the former. He
	was straightway robed in the imperial purple, and became the founder
	of a new dynasty. He did not live long to enjoy his power, or to consolidate
	it for his successors, who, in their turn, were soon swept
	away. In less than sixty years the rule of the Franks at Constantinople
	was brought to as sudden and disastrous a termination as the
	reign of Murzuphlis: and this was the grand result of the fifth Crusade.</p>

	<p>Pope Innocent III., although he had looked with no very unfavourable
	eye upon these proceedings, regretted that nothing had been
	done for the relief of the Holy Land; still, upon every convenient
	occasion, he enforced the necessity of a new Crusade. Until the year
	1213, his exhortations had no other effect than to keep the subject
	in the mind of Europe. Every spring and summer detachments of
	pilgrims continued to set out for Palestine to the aid of their brethren,
	but not in sufficient numbers to be of much service. These periodical
	passages were called the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">passagium Martii</cite>, or the passage of March,
	and the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">passagium Johannis</cite>, or the passage of the festival of St. John.
	These did not consist entirely of soldiers, armed against the Saracen,
	but of pilgrims led by devotion, and in performance of their vows,
	bearing nothing with them but their staff and their wallet. Early in
	the spring of 1213 a more extraordinary body of Crusaders was raised
	in France and Germany. An immense number of boys and girls,
	amounting, according to some accounts, to thirty thousand, were
	incited by the persuasion of two monks to undertake the journey to
	Palestine. They were no doubt composed of the idle and deserted
	children who generally swarm in great cities, nurtured in vice and
	daring, and ready for any thing. The object of the monks seems to
	have been the atrocious one of inveigling them into slave-ships, on
	pretence of sending them to Syria, and selling them for slaves on the
	coast of Africa.<a href="#fn19" id="fnm19" title="See Jacob de Voragine and Albericus." class="fnmarker">19</a> Great numbers of these poor victims were shipped
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"></a>at Marseilles; but the vessels, with the exception of two or three,
	were wrecked on the shores of Italy, and every soul perished. The
	remainder arrived safely in Africa, and were bought up as slaves, and
	sent off into the interior of the country. Another detachment arrived
	at Genoa; but the accomplices in this horrid plot having taken no
	measures at that port, expecting them all at Marseilles, they were
	induced to return to their homes by the Genoese.</p>

	<p>Fuller, in his quaint history of the <cite>Holy Warre</cite>, says that this
	Crusade was done by the instinct of the devil; and he adds a reason,
	which may provoke mirth now, but which was put forth by the worthy
	historian in all soberness and sincerity. He says, “the devil, being
	cloyed with the murdering of men, desired a cordial of children’s blood
	to comfort his weak stomach;” as epicures, when tired of mutton,
	resort to lamb for a change.</p>

	<p>It appears from other authors that the preaching of the vile monks
	had such an effect upon these deluded children that they ran about
	the country, exclaiming, “O Lord Jesus, restore thy cross to us!”
	and that neither bolts nor bars, the fear of fathers, nor the love of
	mothers, was sufficient to restrain them from journeying to Jerusalem.</p>

	<p>The details of these strange proceedings are exceedingly meagre
	and confused, and none of the contemporary writers who mention the
	subject have thought it worth while to state the names of the monks
	who originated the scheme, or the fate they met for their wickedness.
	Two merchants of Marseilles, who were to have shared in the profits,
	were, it is said, brought to justice for some other crime, and suffered
	death; but we are not informed whether they divulged any circumstances
	relating to this matter.</p>

	<p>Pope Innocent III. does not seem to have been aware that the
	causes of this juvenile Crusade were such as have been stated, for,
	upon being informed that numbers of them had taken the cross, and
	were marching to the Holy Land, he exclaimed, “These children are
	awake while we sleep!” He imagined, apparently, that the mind of
	Europe was still bent on the recovery of Palestine, and that the zeal
	of these children implied a sort of reproach upon his own lukewarmness.
	Very soon afterwards, he bestirred himself with more activity,
	and sent an encyclical letter to the clergy of Christendom, urging
	them to preach a new Crusade. As usual, a number of adventurous
	nobles, who had nothing else to do, enrolled themselves with their
	retainers. At a Council of Lateran, which was held while these bands
	were collecting, Innocent announced that he himself would take the
	Cross, and lead the armies of Christ to the defence of his sepulchre.
	In all probability he would have done so, for he was zealous enough;
	but death stepped in, and destroyed his project ere it was ripe. His
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"></a>successor encouraged the Crusade, though he refused to accompany
	it; and the armament continued in France, England, and Germany.
	No leaders of any importance joined it from the former countries.
	Andrew king of Hungary was the only monarch who had leisure or
	inclination to leave his dominions. The Dukes of Austria and Bavaria
	joined him with a considerable army of Germans, and marching to
	Spalatro, took ship for Cyprus, and from thence to Acre.</p>

	<p>The whole conduct of the king of Hungary was marked by pusillanimity
	and irresolution. He found himself in the Holy Land at the
	head of a very efficient army; the Saracens were taken by surprise,
	and were for some weeks unprepared to offer any resistance to his
	arms. He defeated the first body sent to oppose him, and marched
	towards Mount Tabor with the intention of seizing upon an important
	fortress which the Saracens had recently constructed. He arrived
	without impediment at the mount, and might have easily taken it;
	but a sudden fit of cowardice came over him, and he returned to Acre
	without striking a blow. He very soon afterwards abandoned the
	enterprise altogether, and returned to his own country.</p>

	<p>Tardy reinforcements arrived at intervals from Europe; and the
	Duke of Austria, now the chief leader of the expedition, had still sufficient
	forces at his command to trouble the Saracens very seriously.
	It was resolved by him, in council with the other chiefs, that the
	whole energy of the Crusade should be directed upon Egypt, the seat
	of the Saracen power in its relationship to Palestine, and from whence
	were drawn the continual levies that were brought against them by
	the sultan. Damietta, which commanded the river Nile, and was one
	of the most important cities of Egypt, was chosen as the first point of
	attack. The siege was forthwith commenced, and carried on with
	considerable energy, until the Crusaders gained possession of a tower,
	which projected into the middle of the stream, and was looked upon
	as the very key of the city.</p>

	<p>While congratulating themselves upon this success, and wasting
	in revelry the time which should have been employed in turning it to
	further advantage, they received the news of the death of the wise
	Sultan Saphaddin. His two sons, Camhel and Cohreddin, divided his
	empire between them. Syria and Palestine fell to the share of Cohreddin,
	while Egypt was consigned to the other brother, who had for
	some time exercised the functions of lieutenant of that country. Being
	unpopular among the Egyptians, they revolted against him, giving
	the Crusaders a finer opportunity for making a conquest than they
	had ever enjoyed before. But, quarrelsome and licentious as they
	had been from time immemorial, they did not see that the favourable
	moment had come; or seeing, could not profit by it. While they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"></a>were revelling or fighting among themselves, under the walls of Damietta,
	the revolt was suppressed, and Camhel firmly established on the
	throne of Egypt. In conjunction with his brother Cohreddin, his
	next care was to drive the Christians from Damietta, and for upwards
	of three months they bent all their efforts to throw in supplies to the
	besieged, or draw on the besiegers to a general engagement. In
	neither were they successful; and the famine in Damietta became so
	dreadful that vermin of every description were thought luxuries, and
	sold for exorbitant prices. A dead dog became more valuable than a
	live ox in time of prosperity. Unwholesome food brought on disease,
	and the city could hold out no longer for absolute want of men to
	defend the walls.</p>

	<p>Cohreddin and Camhel were alike interested in the preservation
	of so important a position, and, convinced of the certain fate of the
	city, they opened a conference with the crusading chiefs, offering to
	yield the whole of Palestine to the Christians upon the sole condition
	of the evacuation of Egypt. With a blindness and wrong-headedness
	almost incredible, these advantageous terms were refused, chiefly
	through the persuasion of Cardinal Pelagius, an ignorant and obstinate
	fanatic, who urged upon the Duke of Austria and the French
	and English leaders, that infidels never kept their word; that their
	offers were deceptive, and merely intended to betray. The conferences
	were brought to an abrupt termination by the Crusaders, and a last
	attack made upon the walls of Damietta. The besieged made but
	slight resistance, for they had no hope, and the Christians entered
	the city, and found, out of seventy thousand people, but three thousand
	remaining: so fearful had been the ravages of the twin fiends,
	plague and famine.</p>

	<p>Several months were spent in Damietta. The climate either weakened
	the frames or obscured the understandings of the Christians;
	for, after their conquest, they lost all energy, and abandoned themselves
	more unscrupulously than ever to riot and debauchery. John
	of Brienne, who, by right of his wife, was the nominal sovereign of
	Jerusalem, was so disgusted with the pusillanimity, arrogance, and
	dissensions of the chiefs, that he withdrew entirely from them and
	retired to Acre. Large bodies also returned to Europe, and Cardinal
	Pelagius was left at liberty to blast the whole enterprise whenever it
	pleased him. He managed to conciliate John of Brienne, and marched
	forward with these combined forces to attack Cairo. It was only when
	he had approached within a few hours’ march of that city that he discovered
	the inadequacy of his army. He turned back immediately;
	but the Nile had risen since his departure; the sluices were opened,
	and there was no means of reaching Damietta. In this strait, he sued
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"></a>for the peace he had formerly spurned, and, happily for himself, found
	the generous brothers Camhel and Cohreddin still willing to grant it.
	Damietta was soon afterwards given up, and the cardinal returned to
	Europe. John of Brienne retired to Acre, to mourn the loss of his
	kingdom, embittered against the folly of his pretended friends, who
	had ruined where they should have aided him. And thus ended the
	sixth Crusade.</p>

	<p>The seventh was more successful. Frederic II., emperor of Germany,
	had often vowed to lead his armies to the defence of Palestine,
	but was as often deterred from the journey by matters of more pressing
	importance. Cohreddin was a mild and enlightened monarch,
	and the Christians of Syria enjoyed repose and toleration under his
	rule: but John of Brienne was not willing to lose his kingdom without
	an effort; and the popes in Europe were ever willing to embroil
	the nations for the sake of extending their own power. No monarch
	of that age was capable of rendering more effective assistance than
	Frederic of Germany. To inspire him with more zeal, it was proposed
	that he should wed the young Princess Violante, daughter of
	John of Brienne, and heiress of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Frederic
	consented with joy and eagerness. The princess was brought from
	Acre to Rome without delay, and her marriage celebrated on a scale
	of great magnificence. Her father, John of Brienne, abdicated all
	his rights in favour of his son-in-law, and Jerusalem had once more
	a king, who had not only the will, but the power, to enforce his
	claims. Preparations for the new Crusade were immediately commenced,
	and in the course of six months the emperor was at the head
	of a well-disciplined army of sixty thousand men. Matthew Paris
	informs us, that an army of the same amount was gathered in England;
	and most of the writers upon the Crusades adopt his statement.
	When John of Brienne was in England, before his daughter’s marriage
	with the emperor was thought of, praying for the aid of Henry III.
	and his nobles to recover his lost kingdom, he did not meet with
	much encouragement. Grafton, in his <cite>Chronicle</cite>, says, “he departed
	again without any great comfort.” But when a man of more influence
	in European politics appeared upon the scene, the English nobles
	were as ready to sacrifice themselves in the cause as they had been in
	the time of Cœur de Lion.</p>

	<p>The army of Frederic encamped at Brundusium; but a pestilential
	disease having made its appearance among them, their departure was
	delayed for several months. In the mean time the Empress Violante
	died in childbed. John of Brienne, who had already repented of his
	abdication, and was besides incensed against Frederic for many acts
	of neglect and insult, no sooner saw the only tie which bound them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"></a>severed by the death of his daughter, than he began to bestir himself,
	and make interest with the pope to undo what he had done, and
	regain the honorary crown he had renounced. Pope Gregory IX., a
	man of a proud, unconciliating, and revengeful character, owed the
	emperor a grudge for many an act of disobedience to his authority,
	and encouraged the overtures of John of Brienne more than he should
	have done. Frederic, however, despised them both, and, as soon as
	his army was convalescent, set sail for Acre. He had not been many
	days at sea when he was himself attacked with the malady, and
	obliged to return to Otranto, the nearest port. Gregory, who had
	by this time decided in the interest of John of Brienne, excommunicated
	the emperor for returning from so holy an expedition on any
	pretext whatever. Frederic at first treated the excommunication with
	supreme contempt; but when he got well, he gave his holiness to
	understand that he was not to be outraged with impunity, and sent
	some of his troops to ravage the papal territories. This, however,
	only made the matter worse, and Gregory despatched messengers to
	Palestine forbidding the faithful, under severe pains and penalties,
	to hold any intercourse with the excommunicated emperor. Thus
	between them both, the scheme which they had so much at heart
	bade fair to be as effectually ruined as even the Saracens could have
	wished. Frederic still continued his zeal in the Crusade, for he was
	now king of Jerusalem, and fought for himself, and not for Christendom,
	or its representative, Pope Gregory. Hearing that John of
	Brienne was preparing to leave Europe, he lost no time in taking his
	own departure, and arrived safely at Acre. It was here that he first
	experienced the evil effects of excommunication. The Christians of
	Palestine refused to aid him in any way, and looked with distrust, if
	not with abhorrence, upon him. The Templars, Hospitallers, and
	other knights, shared at first the general feeling; but they were not
	men to yield a blind obedience to a distant potentate, especially when
	it compromised their own interests. When, therefore, Frederic prepared
	to march upon Jerusalem without them, they joined his banners
	to a man.</p>

		<p class="caption">TEMPLAR AND HOSPITALLER.</p>
	</div>

	<p>It is said that, previous to quitting Europe, the German emperor
	had commenced a negotiation with the Sultan Camhel for the restoration
	of the Holy Land, and that Camhel, who was jealous of the ambition
	of his brother Cohreddin, was willing to stipulate to that effect,
	on condition of being secured by Frederic in the possession of the
	more important territory of Egypt. But before the Crusaders reached
	Palestine, Camhel was relieved from all fears by the death of his brother.
	He nevertheless did not think it worth while to contest with
	the Crusaders the barren corner of the earth which had already been
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"></a>dyed with so much Christian and Saracen blood, and proposed a truce
	of three years, only stipulating, in addition, that the Moslems should
	be allowed to worship freely in the temple of Jerusalem. This happy
	termination did not satisfy the bigoted Christians of Palestine. The
	tolerance they sought for themselves, they were not willing to extend
	to others, and they complained bitterly of the privilege of free worship
	allowed to their opponents. Unmerited good fortune had made them
	insolent, and they contested the right of the emperor to become a
	party to any treaty, as long as he remained under the ecclesiastical
	ban. Frederic was disgusted with his new subjects; but, as the
	Templars and Hospitallers remained true to him, he marched to Jerusalem
	to be crowned. All the churches were shut against him, and
	he could not even find a priest to officiate at his coronation. He had
	despised the papal authority too long to quail at it now, when it was
	so unjustifiably exerted, and, as there was nobody to crown him, he
	very wisely crowned himself. He took the royal diadem from the
	altar with his own hands, and boldly and proudly placed it on his
	brow. No shouts of an applauding populace made the welkin ring;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"></a>no hymns of praise and triumph resounded from the ministers of religion;
	but a thousand swords started from their scabbards to testify
	that their owners would defend the new monarch to the death.</p>

	<p>It was hardly to be expected that he would renounce for any long
	period the dominion of his native land for the uneasy crown and barren
	soil of Palestine. He had seen quite enough of his new subjects before
	he was six months among them, and more important interests
	called him home. John of Brienne, openly leagued with Pope Gregory
	against him, was actually employed in ravaging his territories
	at the head of a papal army. This intelligence decided his return.
	As a preliminary step, he made those who had contemned his authority
	feel, to their sorrow, that he was their master. He then set sail,
	loaded with the curses of Palestine. And thus ended the seventh
	Crusade, which, in spite of every obstacle and disadvantage, had been
	productive of more real service to the Holy Land than any that had
	gone before; a result solely attributable to the bravery of Frederic
	and the generosity of the Sultan Camhel.</p>

	<p>Soon after the emperor’s departure a new claimant started for the
	throne of Jerusalem, in the person of Alice queen of Cyprus, and
	half-sister of the Mary who, by her marriage, had transferred her right
	to John of Brienne. The grand military orders, however, clung to
	Frederic, and Alice was obliged to withdraw.</p>

	<p>So peaceful a termination to the Crusade did not give unmixed
	pleasure in Europe. The chivalry of France and England were unable
	to rest, and long before the conclusion of the truce, were collecting
	their armies for an eighth expedition. In Palestine also the
	contentment was far from universal. Many petty Mahomedan states
	in the immediate vicinity were not parties to the truce, and harassed
	the frontier towns incessantly. The Templars, ever turbulent, waged
	bitter war with the sultan of Aleppo, and in the end were almost
	exterminated. So great was the slaughter among them that Europe
	resounded with the sad story of their fate, and many a noble knight
	took arms to prevent the total destruction of an order associated with
	so many high and inspiring remembrances. Camhel, seeing the preparations
	that were making, thought that his generosity had been
	sufficiently shewn, and the very day the truce was at an end assumed
	the offensive, and marching forward to Jerusalem, took possession
	of it, after routing the scanty forces of the Christians. Before this
	intelligence reached Europe a large body of Crusaders was on the
	march, headed by the king of Navarre, the Duke of Burgundy, the
	Count de Bretagne, and other leaders. On their arrival, they learned
	that Jerusalem had been taken, but that the sultan was dead, and
	his kingdom torn by rival claimants to the supreme power. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"></a>dissensions of their foes ought to have made them united, but as in all
	previous Crusades, each feudal chief was master of his own host, and
	acted upon his own responsibility, and without reference to any
	general plan. The consequence was that nothing could be done.
	A temporary advantage was gained by one leader, who had no means
	of improving it; while another was defeated, without means of retrieving
	himself. Thus the war lingered till the battle of Gaza, when
	the king of Navarre was defeated with great loss, and compelled to
	save himself from total destruction by entering into a hard and
	oppressive treaty with the emir of Karac.</p>

	<p>At this crisis aid arrived from England, commanded by Richard
	earl of Cornwall, the namesake of Cœur de Lion, and inheritor of
	his valour. His army was strong and full of hope. They had confidence
	in themselves and in their leader, and looked like men accustomed
	to victory. Their coming changed the aspect of affairs. The
	new sultan of Egypt was at war with the sultan of Damascus, and
	had not forces to oppose two enemies so powerful. He therefore
	sent messengers to meet the English earl, offering an exchange of
	prisoners and the complete cession of the Holy Land. Richard, who
	had not come to fight for the mere sake of fighting, agreed at once
	to terms so advantageous, and became the deliverer of Palestine without
	striking a blow. The sultan of Egypt then turned his whole
	force against his Moslem enemies, and the Earl of Cornwall returned
	to Europe. Thus ended the eighth Crusade, the most beneficial of
	all. Christendom had no further pretence for sending her fierce
	levies to the East. To all appearance the holy wars were at an end:
	the Christians had entire possession of Jerusalem, Tripoli, Antioch,
	Edessa, Acre, Jaffa, and, in fact, of nearly all Judea; and, could
	they have been at peace among themselves, they might have overcome,
	without great difficulty, the jealousy and hostility of their
	neighbours. A circumstance, as unforeseen as it was disastrous,
	blasted this fair prospect, and reillumed, for the last time, the fervour
	and fury of the Crusades.</p>

	<p>Gengis Khan and his successors had swept over Asia like a tropical
	storm, overturning in their progress the landmarks of ages.
	Kingdom after kingdom was cast down as they issued, innumerable,
	from the far recesses of the North and East, and, among others,
	the empire of Korasmin was overrun by these all-conquering hordes.
	The Korasmins, a fierce, uncivilised race, thus driven from their
	homes, spread themselves, in their turn, over the south of Asia with
	fire and sword, in search of a resting-place. In their impetuous
	course they directed themselves towards Egypt, whose sultan, unable
	to withstand the swarm that had cast their longing eyes on the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"></a>fertile valleys of the Nile, endeavoured to turn them from their
	course. For this purpose, he sent emissaries to Barbaquan, their
	leader, inviting them to settle in Palestine; and the offer being accepted
	by the wild horde, they entered the country before the Christians
	received the slightest intimation of their coming. It was as
	sudden as it was overwhelming. Onwards, like the simoom, they
	came, burning and slaying, and were at the walls of Jerusalem before
	the inhabitants had time to look round them. They spared
	neither life nor property; they slew women and children, and priests
	at the altar, and profaned even the graves of those who had slept for
	ages. They tore down every vestige of the Christian faith, and committed
	horrors unparalleled in the history of warfare. About seven
	thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem sought safety in retreat;
	but before they were out of sight, the banner of the cross was hoisted
	upon the walls by the savage foe to decoy them back. The artifice
	was but too successful. The poor fugitives imagined that help had
	arrived from another direction, and turned back to regain their
	homes. Nearly the whole of them were massacred, and the streets
	of Jerusalem ran with blood.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:301px;">

		<p class="caption">JAFFA.</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"></a>The Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic knights forgot their
	long and bitter animosities, and joined hand in hand to rout out this
	desolating foe. They entrenched themselves in Jaffa with all the
	chivalry of Palestine that yet remained, and endeavoured to engage
	the sultans of Emissa and Damascus to assist them against the common
	enemy. The aid obtained from the Moslems amounted at first
	to only four thousand men, but with these reinforcements Walter of
	Brienne, the lord of Jaffa, resolved to give battle to the Korasmins.
	The conflict was as deadly as despair on the one side, and unmitigated
	ferocity on the other, could make it. It lasted with varying
	fortune for two days, when the sultan of Emissa fled to his fortifications,
	and Walter of Brienne fell into the enemy’s hands. The brave
	knight was suspended by the arms to a cross in sight of the walls of
	Jaffa, and the Korasminian leader declared that he should remain in
	that position until the city surrendered. Walter raised his feeble
	voice, not to advise surrender, but to command his soldiers to hold
	out to the last. But his gallantry was unavailing. So great had
	been the slaughter, that out of the grand array of knights, there
	now remained but sixteen Hospitallers, thirty-three Templars, and
	three Teutonic cavaliers. These with the sad remnant of the army
	fled to Acre, and the Korasmins were masters of Palestine.</p>

	<p>The sultans of Syria preferred the Christians to this fierce horde
	for their neighbours. Even the sultan of Egypt began to regret the
	aid he had given to such barbarous foes, and united with those of
	Emissa and Damascus to root them from the land. The Korasmins
	amounted to but twenty thousand men, and were unable to resist
	the determined hostility which encompassed them on every side.
	The sultans defeated them in several engagements, and the peasantry
	rose up in masses to take vengeance upon them. Gradually
	their numbers were diminished. No mercy was shewn them in defeat.
	Barbaquan their leader was slain; and after five years of
	desperate struggles, they were finally extirpated, and Palestine became
	once more the territory of the Mussulmans.</p>

	</div>

	<p>A short time previous to this devastating eruption, Louis IX. fell
	sick in Paris, and dreamed in the delirium of his fever that he saw
	the Christian and Moslem host fighting before Jerusalem, and the
	Christians defeated with great slaughter. The dream made a great
	impression on his superstitious mind, and he made a solemn vow,
	that if ever he recovered his health, he would take a pilgrimage to
	the Holy Land. When the news of the misfortunes of Palestine, and
	the awful massacres at Jerusalem and Jaffa, arrived in Europe, St.
	Louis remembered him of his dream. More persuaded than ever that it
	was an intimation direct from heaven, he prepared to take the cross at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"></a>the head of his armies, and march to the deliverance of the Holy
	Sepulchre. From that moment he doffed the royal mantle of purple
	and ermine, and dressed in the sober serge becoming a pilgrim. All
	his thoughts were directed to the fulfilment of his design, and although
	his kingdom could but ill spare him, he made every preparation
	to leave it. Pope Innocent IV. applauded his zeal and afforded
	him every assistance. He wrote to Henry III. of England to forward
	the cause in his dominions, and called upon the clergy and
	laity all over Europe to contribute towards it. William Longsword,
	the celebrated Earl of Salisbury, took the cross at the head of a great
	number of valiant knights and soldiers. But the fanaticism of the
	people was not to be awakened either in France or England. Great
	armies were raised, but the masses no longer sympathised. Taxation
	had been the great cooler of zeal. It was no longer a disgrace even
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"></a>to a knight if he refused to take the cross. Rutebeuf, a French
	minstrel, who flourished about this time (1250), composed a dialogue
	between a Crusader and a non-Crusader, which the reader will
	find translated in Way’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fabliaux</cite>. The Crusader uses every argument
	to persuade the non-Crusader to take up arms, and forsake
	every thing, in the holy cause; but it is evident from the greater
	force of the arguments used by the non-Crusader, that he was the
	favourite of the minstrel. To a most urgent solicitation of his friend
	the Crusader, he replies:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“I read thee right, thou holdest good</p>
		<p class="i2">To this same land I straight should hie,</p>
		<p>And win it back with mickle blood,</p>
		<p class="i2">Nor gaine one foot of soil thereby;</p>
		<p>While here dejected and forlorn</p>
		<p class="i2">My wife and babes are left to mourn;</p>
		<p>My goodly mansion rudely marred,</p>

		<p class="i2">And troth I mean to follow it.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">This being the general feeling, it is not to be wondered at that Louis IX.
	was occupied fully three years in organising his forces, and in making
	the necessary preparations for his departure. When all was ready he
	set sail for Cyprus, accompanied by his queen, his two brothers, the
	Counts d’Anjou and d’Artois, and a long train of the noblest chivalry
	of France. His third brother, the Count de Poitiers, remained behind
	to collect another corps of Crusaders, and followed him in a few
	months afterwards. The army united at Cyprus, and amounted to
	fifty thousand men, exclusive of the English Crusaders under William
	Longsword. Again, a pestilential disease made its appearance, to
	which many hundreds fell victims. It was in consequence found
	necessary to remain in Cyprus until the spring. Louis then embarked
	for Egypt with his whole host; but a violent tempest separated his
	fleet, and he arrived before Damietta with only a few thousand men.
	They were, however, impetuous and full of hope; and although the
	Sultan Melick Shah was drawn up on the shore with a force infinitely
	superior, it was resolved to attempt a landing without waiting
	the arrival of the rest of the army. Louis himself, in wild impatience,
	sprang from his boat, and waded on shore; while his army, inspired
	by his enthusiastic bravery, followed, shouting the old war-cry of
	the first Crusaders, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu le veut! Dieu le veut!</em> A panic seized the
	Turks. A body of their cavalry attempted to bear down upon the
	Crusaders, but the knights fixed their large shields deep in the sands
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"></a>of the shore, and rested their lances upon them, so that they projected
	above, and formed a barrier so imposing, that the Turks,
	afraid to breast it, turned round and fairly took to flight. At the
	moment of this panic, a false report was spread in the Saracen host,
	that the sultan had been slain. The confusion immediately became
	general—the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deroute</em> was complete: Damietta itself was abandoned,
	and the same night the victorious Crusaders fixed their head-quarters
	in that city. The soldiers who had been separated from their chief
	by the tempest arrived shortly afterwards; and Louis was in a position
	to justify the hope, not only of the conquest of Palestine, but
	of Egypt itself.</p>

	<p>But too much confidence proved the bane of his army. They
	thought, as they had accomplished so much, that nothing more
	remained to be done, and gave themselves up to ease and luxury.
	When, by the command of Louis, they marched towards Cairo, they
	were no longer the same men; success, instead of inspiring, had unnerved
	them; debauchery had brought on disease, and disease was
	aggravated by the heat of a climate to which none of them were accustomed.
	Their progress towards Massoura, on the road to Cairo,
	was checked by the Thanisian canal, on the banks of which the Saracens
	were drawn up to dispute the passage. Louis gave orders that
	a bridge should be thrown across: and the operations commenced
	under cover of two cat-castles, or high movable towers. The Saracens
	soon destroyed them by throwing quantities of Greek fire, the
	artillery of that day, upon them, and Louis was forced to think of
	some other means of effecting his design. A peasant agreed, for a
	considerable bribe, to point out a ford where the army might wade
	across, and the Count d’Artois was despatched with fourteen hundred
	men to attempt it, while Louis remained to face the Saracens
	with the main body of the army. The Count d’Artois got safely
	over, and defeated the detachment that had been sent to oppose his
	landing. Flushed with the victory, the brave count forgot the inferiority
	of his numbers, and pursued the panic-stricken enemy into
	Massoura. He was now completely cut off from the aid of his brother
	Crusaders, which the Moslems perceiving, took courage and returned
	upon him, with a force swollen by the garrison of Massoura,
	and by reinforcements from the surrounding districts. The battle
	now became hand to hand. The Christians fought with the energy
	of desperate men, but the continually increasing numbers of the foe
	surrounded them completely, and cut off all hope, either of victory
	or escape. The Count d’Artois was among the foremost of the slain;
	and when Louis arrived to the rescue, the brave advanced-guard was
	nearly cut to pieces. Of the fourteen hundred but three hundred
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"></a>remained. The fury of the battle was now increased threefold. The
	French king and his troops performed prodigies of valour, and the
	Saracens, under the command of the Emir Ceccidun, fought as if
	they were determined to exterminate, in one last decisive effort, the
	new European swarm that had settled upon their coast. At the fall
	of the evening dews the Christians were masters of the field of Massoura,
	and flattered themselves that they were the victors. Self-love
	would not suffer them to confess that the Saracens had withdrawn,
	and not retreated; but their leaders were too wofully convinced
	that that fatal field had completed the disorganisation of the Christian
	army, and that all hopes of future conquest were at an end.</p>

	<p>Impressed with this truth, the Crusaders sued for peace. The
	sultan insisted upon the immediate evacuation of Damietta, and that
	Louis himself should be delivered as hostage for the fulfilment of the
	condition. His army at once refused, and the negotiations were
	broken off. It was now resolved to attempt a retreat; but the agile
	Saracens, now in the front and now in the rear, rendered it a matter of
	extreme difficulty, and cut off the stragglers in great numbers. Hundreds
	of them were drowned in the Nile; and sickness and famine
	worked sad ravages upon those who escaped all other casualties. Louis
	himself was so weakened by disease, fatigue, and discouragement,
	that he was hardly able to sit upon his horse. In the confusion of
	the flight he was separated from his attendants, and left a total
	stranger upon the sands of Egypt, sick, weary, and almost friendless.
	One knight, Geffry de Sergines, alone attended him, and led him
	to a miserable hut in a small village, where for several days he lay
	in the hourly expectation of death. He was at last discovered and
	taken prisoner by the Saracens, who treated him with all the honour
	due to his rank and all the pity due to his misfortunes. Under
	their care his health rapidly improved, and the next consideration
	was that of his ransom.</p>

	<p>The Saracens demanded, besides money, the cession of Acre, Tripoli,
	and other cities of Palestine. Louis unhesitatingly refused, and
	conducted himself with so much pride and courage that the sultan
	declared he was the proudest infidel he had ever beheld. After a
	good deal of haggling, the sultan agreed to waive these conditions,
	and a treaty was finally concluded. The city of Damietta was restored;
	a truce of ten years agreed upon, and ten thousand golden
	bezants paid for the release of Louis and the liberation of all the captives.
	Louis then withdrew to Jaffa, and spent two years in putting
	that city, and Cesarea, with the other possessions of the Christians in
	Palestine, into a proper state of defence. He then returned to his own
	country, with great reputation as a saint, but very little as a soldier.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"></a>Matthew Paris informs us that, in the year 1250, while Louis was
	in Egypt, “thousands of the English were resolved to go to the holy
	war, had not the king strictly guarded his ports and kept his people
	from running out of doors.” When the news arrived of the reverses
	and captivity of the French king, their ardour cooled; and the Crusade
	was sung of only, but not spoken of.</p>

	<p>In France, a very different feeling was the result. The news of
	the king’s capture spread consternation through the country. A fanatic
	monk of Citeaux suddenly appeared in the villages, preaching to
	the people, and announcing that the Holy Virgin, accompanied by a
	whole army of saints and martyrs, had appeared to him, and commanded
	him to stir up the shepherds and farm-labourers to the defence
	of the cross. To them only was his discourse addressed; and
	his eloquence was such, that thousands flocked around him, ready to
	follow wherever he should lead. The pastures and the corn-fields
	were deserted, and the shepherds, or <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pastoureaux</em>, as they were termed,
	became at last so numerous as to amount to upwards of fifty thousand,—Millot
	says one hundred thousand men.<a href="#fn20" id="fnm20" title="Elémens de l'Histoire de France." class="fnmarker">20</a> The Queen Blanche,
	who governed as regent during the absence of the king, encouraged
	at first the armies of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pastoureaux</em>; but they soon gave way to such
	vile excesses that the peaceably disposed were driven to resistance.
	Robbery, murder, and violation marked their path; and all good
	men, assisted by the government, united in putting them down.
	They were finally dispersed, but not before three thousand of them
	had been massacred. Many authors say that the slaughter was still
	greater.</p>

	<p>The ten years’ truce concluded in 1264, and St. Louis was urged
	by two powerful motives to undertake a second expedition for the
	relief of Palestine. These were, fanaticism on the one hand, and a
	desire of retrieving his military fame on the other, which had suffered
	more than his parasites liked to remind him of. The pope, of course,
	encouraged his design, and once more the chivalry of Europe began
	to bestir themselves. In 1268, Edward, the heir of the English monarchy,
	announced his determination to join the Crusade; and the
	pope (Clement IV.) wrote to the prelates and clergy to aid the cause
	by their persuasions and their revenues. In England, they agreed to
	contribute a tenth of their possessions; and by a parliamentary order,
	a twentieth was taken from the corn and movables of all the laity at
	Michaelmas.</p>

	<p>In spite of the remonstrances of the few clear-headed statesmen
	who surrounded him, urging the ruin that might in consequence fall
	upon his then prosperous kingdom, Louis made every preparation for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"></a>his departure. The warlike nobility were nothing loath; and in the
	spring of 1270, the king set sail with an army of sixty thousand men.
	He was driven by stress of weather into Sardinia, and while there, a
	change in his plans took place. Instead of proceeding to Acre, as he
	originally intended, he shaped his course for Tunis, on the African
	coast. The king of Tunis had some time previously expressed himself
	favourably disposed towards the Christians and their religion, and
	Louis, it appears, had hopes of converting him, and securing his aid
	against the sultan of Egypt. “What honour would be mine,” he
	used to say, “if I could become godfather to this Mussulman king!”
	Filled with this idea he landed in Africa, near the site of the city of
	Carthage, but found that he had reckoned without his host. The
	king of Tunis had no thoughts of renouncing his religion, nor intention
	of aiding the Crusaders in any way. On the contrary, he opposed
	their landing with all the forces that could be collected on so sudden
	an emergency. The French, however, made good their first position,
	and defeated the Moslems with considerable loss. They also gained
	some advantage over the reinforcements that were sent to oppose
	them; but an infectious flux appeared in the army, and put a stop
	to all future victories. The soldiers died at the rate of a hundred in
	a day. The enemy, at the same time, made as great havoc as the
	plague. St. Louis himself was one of the first attacked by the disease.
	His constitution had been weakened by fatigues, and even before he
	left France he was unable to bear the full weight of his armour. It
	was soon evident to his sorrowing soldiers that their beloved monarch
	could not long survive. He lingered for some days, and died in Carthage
	in the fifty-sixth year of his age, deeply regretted by his army
	and his subjects, and leaving behind him one of the most singular
	reputations in history. He is the model-king of ecclesiastical writers,
	in whose eyes his very defects became virtues, because they were
	manifested in furtherance of their cause. More unprejudiced historians,
	while they condemn his fanaticism, admit that he was endowed
	with many high and rare qualities; that he was in no one
	point behind his age, and in many in advance of it.</p>

	<p>His brother, Charles of Anjou, in consequence of a revolution in
	Sicily, had become king of that country. Before he heard of the
	death of Louis, he had sailed from Messina with large reinforcements.
	On his landing near Carthage, he advanced at the head of his army,
	amid the martial music of drums and trumpets. He was soon informed
	how inopportune was his rejoicing, and shed tears before his
	whole army, such as no warrior would have been ashamed to shed.
	A peace was speedily agreed upon with the king of Tunis, and the
	armies of France and Sicily returned to their homes.</p>

	</div>

	<p>So little favour had the Crusade found in England, that even the
	exertions of the heir to the throne had only collected a small force of
	fifteen hundred men. With these few Prince Edward sailed from
	Dover to Bourdeaux, in the expectation that he would find the French
	king in that city. St. Louis, however, had left a few weeks previously;
	upon which Edward followed him to Sardinia, and afterwards
	to Tunis. Before his arrival in Africa, St. Louis was no more,
	and peace had been concluded between France and Tunis. He determined,
	however, not to relinquish the Crusade. Returning to
	Sicily, he passed the winter in that country, and endeavoured to augment
	his little army. In the spring he set sail for Palestine, and
	arrived in safety at Acre. The Christians were torn, as usual, by
	mutual jealousies and animosities. The two great military orders
	were as virulent and as intractable as ever; opposed to each other,
	and to all the world. The arrival of Edward had the effect of causing
	them to lay aside their unworthy contention, and of uniting heart
	to heart in one last effort for the deliverance of their adopted country.
	A force of six thousand effective warriors was soon formed to join
	those of the English prince, and preparations were made for the renewal
	of hostilities. The Sultan Bibars or Bendocdar,<a href="#fn21" id="fnm21" title="Mills, in his history..." class="fnmarker">21</a> a fierce Mamluke,
	who had been placed on the throne by a bloody revolution, was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"></a>at war with all his neighbours, and unable, for that reason, to concentrate
	his whole strength against them. Edward took advantage
	of this, and marching boldly forward to Nazareth, defeated the Turks
	and gained possession of that city. This was the whole amount of
	his successes. The hot weather engendered disease among his troops,
	and he himself, the life and soul of the expedition, fell sick among
	the first. He had been ill for some time, and was slowly recovering,
	when a messenger desired to speak with him on important matters,
	and to deliver some despatches into his own hand. While the prince
	was occupied in examining them, the traitorous messenger drew a
	dagger from his belt and stabbed him in the breast. The wound fortunately
	was not deep, and Edward had regained a portion of his
	strength. He struggled with the assassin, and put him to death with
	his own dagger, at the same time calling loudly for assistance.<a href="#fn22" id="fnm22" title="The reader will recognise..." class="fnmarker">22</a> His
	attendants came at his call, and found him bleeding profusely, and
	ascertained on inspection that the dagger was poisoned. Means were
	instantly taken to purify the wound, and an antidote was sent by the
	Grand Master of the Templars which removed all danger from the
	effects of the poison. Camden, in his history, has adopted the more
	popular, and certainly more beautiful version of this story, which
	says that the Princess Eleonora, in her love for her gallant husband,
	sucked the poison from his wound at the risk of her own life: to use
	the words of old Fuller, “it is a pity so pretty a story should not be
	true; and that so sovereign a remedy as a woman’s tongue, anointed
	with the virtue of loving affection,” should not have performed the
	good deed.</p>

	<p>Edward suspected, and doubtless not without reason, that the
	assassin was employed by the sultan of Egypt. But it amounted to
	suspicion only; and by the sudden death of the assassin the principal
	clue to the discovery of the truth was lost for ever. Edward, on his
	recovery, prepared to resume the offensive; but the sultan, embarrassed
	by the defence of interests which, for the time being, he considered
	of more importance, made offers of peace to the Crusaders.
	This proof of weakness on the part of the enemy was calculated to
	render a man of Edward’s temperament more anxious to prosecute
	the war; but he had also other interests to defend. News arrived in
	Palestine of the death of his father, King Henry III.; and his presence
	being necessary in England, he agreed to the terms of the sultan.
	These were, that the Christians should be allowed to retain
	their possessions in the Holy Land, and that a truce of ten years
	<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"></a>should be proclaimed. Edward then set sail for England; and thus
	ended the last Crusade.</p>

	<p>The after-fate of the Holy Land may be told in a few words. The
	Christians, unmindful of their past sufferings and of the jealous neighbours
	they had to deal with, first broke the truce by plundering some
	Egyptian traders near Margat. The sultan immediately revenged the
	outrage by taking possession of Margat, and war once more raged
	between the nations. Margat made a gallant defence, but no reinforcements
	arrived from Europe to prevent its fall. Tripoli was the
	next, and other cities in succession, until at last Acre was the only
	city of Palestine that remained in possession of the Christians.</p>

		<p class="caption">TOMB OF QUEEN ELEANOR.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The Grand Master of the Templars collected together his small
	and devoted band, and, with the trifling aid afforded by the King of
	Cyprus, prepared to defend to the death the last possession of his
	order. Europe was deaf to his cry for aid, the numbers of the foe
	were overwhelming, and devoted bravery was of no avail. In that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"></a>disastrous siege the Christians were all but exterminated. The king
	of Cyprus fled when he saw that resistance was vain, and the Grand
	Master fell at the head of his knights, pierced with a hundred wounds.
	Seven Templars, and as many Hospitallers, alone escaped from the
	dreadful carnage. The victorious Moslems then set fire to the city,
	and the rule of the Christians in Palestine was brought to a close for
	ever.</p>

	<p>This intelligence spread alarm and sorrow among the clergy of
	Europe, who endeavoured to rouse once more the energy and enthusiasm
	of the nations in the cause of the Holy Land. But the popular
	mania had run its career; the spark of zeal had burned its appointed
	time, and was never again to be re-illumined. Here and there a solitary
	knight announced his determination to take up arms, and now
	and then a king gave cold encouragement to the scheme; but it
	dropped almost as soon as spoken of, to be renewed again, still more
	feebly, at some longer interval.</p>

	<p>Now what was the grand result of all these struggles? Europe
	expended millions of her treasures, and the blood of two millions of
	her children; and a handful of quarrelsome knights retained possession
	of Palestine for about one hundred years! Even had Christendom
	retained it to this day, the advantage, if confined to that, would
	have been too dearly purchased. But notwithstanding the fanaticism
	that originated, and the folly that conducted them, the Crusades were
	not productive of unmitigated evil. The feudal chiefs became better
	members of society by coming in contact, in Asia, with a civilisation
	superior to their own; the people secured some small instalments of
	their rights; kings, no longer at war with their nobility, had time to
	pass some good laws; the human mind learned some little wisdom
	from hard experience, and, casting off the slough of superstition in
	which the Roman clergy had so long enveloped it, became prepared
	to receive the seeds of the approaching Reformation. Thus did the
	all-wise Disposer of events bring good out of evil, and advance the
	civilisation and ultimate happiness of the nations of the West by means
	of the very fanaticism that had led them against the East. But the
	whole subject is one of absorbing interest, and, if carried fully out in
	all its bearings, would consume more space than the plan of this work
	will allow. The philosophic student will draw his own conclusions;
	and he can have no better field for the exercise of his powers than
	this European madness—its advantages and disadvantages, its causes
	and results.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> belief that disembodied spirits may be permitted to revisit this
	world has its foundation upon that sublime hope of immortality which
	is at once the chief solace and greatest triumph of our reason. Even
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"></a>if revelation did not teach us, we feel that we have that within us
	which shall never die; and all our experience of this life but makes
	us cling the more fondly to that one repaying hope. But in the early
	days of “little knowledge” this grand belief became the source of a
	whole train of superstitions, which, in their turn, became the fount
	from whence flowed a deluge of blood and horror. Europe, for a
	period of two centuries and a half, brooded upon the idea, not only
	that parted spirits walked the earth to meddle in the affairs of men,
	but that men had power to summon evil spirits to their aid to work
	woe upon their fellows. An epidemic terror seized upon the nations;
	no man thought himself secure, either in his person or possessions,
	from the machinations of the devil and his agents. Every calamity
	that befell him he attributed to a witch. If a storm arose and blew
	down his barn, it was witchcraft; if his cattle died of a murrain—if
	disease fastened upon his limbs, or death entered suddenly and snatched
	a beloved face from his hearth—they were not visitations of Providence,
	but the works of some neighbouring hag, whose wretchedness
	or insanity caused the ignorant to raise their finger and point at her
	as a witch. The word was upon every body’s tongue. France, Italy,
	Germany, England, Scotland, and the far north successively ran mad
	upon this subject, and for a long series of years furnished their tribunals
	with so many trials for witchcraft, that other crimes were seldom
	or never spoken of. Thousands upon thousands of unhappy persons
	fell victims to this cruel and absurd delusion. In many cities of Germany,
	as will be shewn more fully in its due place hereafter, the
	average number of executions for this pretended crime was six hundred
	annually, or two every day, if we leave out the Sundays, when
	it is to be supposed that even this madness refrained from its work.</p>

	<p>A misunderstanding of the famous text of the Mosaic law, “Thou
	shalt not suffer a witch to live,” no doubt led many conscientious
	men astray, whose superstition, warm enough before, wanted but a
	little corroboration to blaze out with desolating fury. In all ages of
	the world men have tried to hold converse with superior beings, and
	to pierce by their means the secrets of futurity. In the time of
	Moses, it is evident that there were impostors who trafficked upon
	the credulity of mankind, and insulted the supreme majesty of the
	true God by pretending to the power of divination. Hence the law
	which Moses, by Divine command, promulgated against these criminals;
	but it did not follow, as the superstitious monomaniacs of the
	middle ages imagined, that the Bible established the existence of the
	power of divination by its edicts against those who pretended to it.
	From the best authorities, it appears that the Hebrew word, which
	has been rendered <em>venefica</em> and <em>witch</em>, means a poisoner and divineress,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"></a>a dabbler in spells, or fortune-teller. The modern witch was a very
	different character, and joined to her pretended power of foretelling
	future events that of working evil upon the life, limbs, and possessions
	of mankind. This power was only to be acquired by an express compact,
	signed in blood, with the devil himself, by which the wizard or
	witch renounced baptism, and sold his or her immortal soul to the
	evil one, without any saving clause of redemption.</p>

	<p>There are so many wondrous appearances in nature for which
	science and philosophy cannot even now account, that it is not surprising
	that, when natural laws were still less understood, men should
	have attributed to supernatural agency every appearance which they
	could not otherwise explain. The merest tyro now understands various
	phenomena which the wisest of old could not fathom. The schoolboy
	knows why, upon high mountains, there should on certain occasions
	appear three or four suns in the firmament at once, and why
	the figure of a traveller upon one eminence should be reproduced,
	inverted and of a gigantic stature, upon another. We all know the
	strange pranks which imagination can play in certain diseases; that
	the hypochondriac can see visions and spectres; and that there have
	been cases in which men were perfectly persuaded that they were teapots.
	Science has lifted up the veil, and rolled away all the fantastic
	horrors in which our forefathers shrouded these and similar cases.
	The man who now imagines himself a wolf is sent to the hospital
	instead of to the stake, as in the days of the witch mania; and earth,
	air, and sea are unpeopled of the grotesque spirits that were once
	believed to haunt them.</p>

	<p>Before entering further into the history of Witchcraft, it may be
	as well if we consider the absurd impersonation of the evil principle
	formed by the monks in their legends. We must make acquaintance
	with the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum mobile</em>, and understand what sort of a personage
	it was who gave the witches, in exchange for their souls, the power
	to torment their fellow-creatures. The popular notion of the devil
	was, that he was a large, ill-formed, hairy sprite, with horns, a long
	tail, cloven feet, and dragon’s wings. In this shape he was constantly
	brought on the stage by the monks in their early “miracles”
	and “mysteries.” In these representations he was an important personage,
	and answered the purpose of the clown in the modern pantomime.
	The great fun for the people was to see him well belaboured
	by the saints with clubs or cudgels, and to hear him howl with pain
	as he limped off, maimed by the blow of some vigorous anchorite.
	St. Dunstan generally served him the glorious trick for which he is
	renowned, catching hold of his nose with a pair of red-hot pincers, till</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Rocks and distant dells resounded with his cries.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"></a>Some of the saints spat in his face, to his very great annoyance; and
	others chopped pieces off of his tail, which, however, always grew on
	again. This was paying him in his own coin, and amused the populace
	mightily, for they all remembered the scurvy tricks he had
	played them and their forefathers. It was believed that he endeavoured
	to trip people up by laying his long invisible tail in their
	way, and giving it a sudden whisk when their legs were over it;—that
	he used to get drunk, and swear like a trooper, and be so mischievous
	in his cups as to raise tempests and earthquakes, to destroy
	the fruits of the earth, and the barns and homesteads of true
	believers;—that he used to run invisible spits into people by way
	of amusing himself in the long winter evenings, and to proceed to
	taverns and regale himself with the best, offering in payment pieces
	of gold which, on the dawn of the following morning, invariably
	turned into slates. Sometimes, disguised as a large drake, he used to
	lurk among the bulrushes, and frighten the weary traveller out of his
	wits by his awful quack. The reader will remember the lines of
	Burns in his address to the “De’il,” which so well express the popular
	notion on this point:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>“Ae dreary, windy, winter night,</p>
			<p>The stars shot down wi’ sklentin light,</p>
			<p>Wi’ you mysel, I got a fright</p>
			<p class="i8">Ayont the lough;</p>
			<p>Ye, like a rash-bush, stood in sight</p>
			<p class="i8">Wi’ waving sough.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>The cudgel in my nieve did shake,</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>In all the stories circulated and believed about him, he was represented
	as an ugly, petty, mischievous spirit, who rejoiced in playing
	off all manner of fantastic tricks upon poor humanity. Milton
	seems to have been the first who succeeded in giving any but a ludicrous
	description of him. The sublime pride, which is the quintessence of
	evil, was unconceived before his time. All other limners made him
	merely grotesque, but Milton made him awful. In this the monks
	shewed themselves but miserable romancers; for their object undoubtedly
	was to represent the fiend as terrible as possible. But there was
	nothing grand about their Satan; on the contrary, he was a low, mean
	devil, whom it was easy to circumvent, and fine fun to play tricks
	with. But, as is well and eloquently remarked by a modern writer,<a href="#fn23" id="fnm23" title="See article..." class="fnmarker">23</a>
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"></a>the subject has also its serious side. An Indian deity, with its wild
	distorted shape and grotesque attitude, appears merely ridiculous
	when separated from its accessories and viewed by daylight in a museum;
	but restore it to the darkness of its own hideous temple, bring
	back to our recollection the victims that have bled upon its altar or
	been crushed beneath its car, and our sense of the ridiculous subsides
	into aversion and horror. So, while the superstitious dreams of former
	times are regarded as mere speculative insanities, we may be for
	a moment amused with the wild incoherencies of the patients; but
	when we reflect that out of these hideous misconceptions of the
	principle of evil arose the belief in witchcraft—that this was no dead
	faith, but one operating on the whole being of society, urging on the
	wisest and the mildest to deeds of murder, or cruelties scarcely less
	than murder—that the learned and the beautiful, young and old,
	male and female, were devoted by its influence to the stake and the
	scaffold—every feeling disappears, except that of astonishment that
	such things could be, and humiliation at the thought that the delusion
	was as lasting as it was universal.</p>

	<p>Besides this chief personage, there was an infinite number of inferior
	demons, who played conspicuous parts in the creed of witchcraft.
	The pages of Bekker, Leloyer, Bodin, Delrio, and De Lancre,
	abound with descriptions of the qualities of these imps, and the functions
	which were assigned them. From these authors,—three of
	whom were commissioners for the trial of witches, and who wrote
	from the confessions made by the supposed criminals and the evidence
	delivered against them,—and from the more recent work of M. Jules
	Garinet, the following summary of the creed has been, with great
	pains, extracted. The student who is desirous of knowing more is
	referred to the works in question; he will find enough in every leaf
	to make his blood curdle with shame and horror: but the purity of
	these pages shall not be soiled by any thing so ineffably humiliating
	and disgusting as a complete exposition of them; what is here culled
	will be a sufficient sample of the popular belief, and the reader would
	but lose time who should seek in the writings of the demonologists
	for more ample details. He will gain nothing by lifting the veil
	which covers their unutterable obscenities, unless, like Sterne, he
	wishes to gather fresh evidence of “what a beast man is.” In that
	case, he will find plenty there to convince him that the beast would
	be libelled by the comparison.</p>

	<p>It was thought that the earth swarmed with millions of demons
	of both sexes, many of whom, like the human race, traced their
	lineage up to Adam, who after the fall was led astray by devils,
	assuming the forms of beautiful women to deceive him. These 
	<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"></a>demons “increased and multiplied” among themselves with the most
	extraordinary rapidity. Their bodies were of the thin air, and they
	could pass through the hardest substances with the greatest ease.
	They had no fixed residence or abiding place, but were tossed to
	and fro in the immensity of space. When thrown together in great
	multitudes, they excited whirlwinds in the air and tempests in the
	waters, and took delight in destroying the beauty of nature and the
	monuments of the industry of man. Although they increased among
	themselves like ordinary creatures, their numbers were daily augmented
	by the souls of wicked men, of children still-born, of women
	who died in childbed, and of persons killed in duels. The
	whole air was supposed to be full of them, and many unfortunate
	men and women drew them by thousands into their mouths and nostrils
	at every inspiration; and the demons, lodging in their bowels
	or other parts of their bodies, tormented them with pains and diseases
	of every kind, and sent them frightful dreams. St. Gregory of
	Nice relates a story of a nun who forgot to say her <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">benedicite</em> and
	make the sign of the cross before she sat down to supper, and
	who in consequence swallowed a demon concealed among the leaves
	of a lettuce. Most persons said the number of these demons was so
	great that they could not be counted, but Wierus asserted that they
	amounted to no more than seven millions four hundred and five
	thousand nine hundred and twenty-six; and that they were divided
	into seventy-two companies or battalions, to each of which there was
	a prince or captain.  They could assume any shape they pleased.
	When they were male, they were called incubi; and when female,
	succubi. They sometimes made themselves hideous; and at other
	times they assumed shapes of such transcendent loveliness, that
	mortal eyes never saw beauty to compete with theirs.</p>

	<p>Although the devil and his legions could appear to mankind at any
	time, it was generally understood that he preferred the night between
	Friday and Saturday. If Satan himself appeared in human shape, he
	was never perfectly and in all respects like a man. He was either
	too black or too white, too large or too small, or some of his limbs
	were out of proportion to the rest of his body. Most commonly his
	feet were deformed, and he was obliged to curl up and conceal his
	tail in some part of his habiliments; for, take what shape he would,
	he could not get rid of that encumbrance. He sometimes changed
	himself into a tree or a river; and upon one occasion he transformed
	himself into a barrister, as we learn from Wierus, book iv. chapter 9.
	In the reign of Philippe le Bel, he appeared to a monk in the shape
	of a dark man riding a tall black horse, then as a friar, afterwards
	as an ass and finally as a coach-wheel. Instances are not rare in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"></a>which both he and his inferior demons have taken the form of handsome
	young men, and, successfully concealing their tails, have married
	beautiful young women, who have had children by them. Such
	children were easily recognisable by their continual shrieking, by
	their requiring five nurses to suckle them, and by their never growing
	fat.</p>

	<p>All these demons were at the command of any individual who
	would give up his immortal soul to the prince of evil for the privilege
	of enjoying their services for a stated period. The wizard or witch
	could send them to execute the most difficult missions: whatever the
	witch commanded was performed, except it was a good action, in
	which case the order was disobeyed, and evil worked upon herself
	instead.</p>

	<p>At intervals, according to the pleasure of Satan, there was a general
	meeting of the demons and all the witches. This meeting was
	called the Sabbath, from its taking place on the Saturday, or immediately
	after midnight on Fridays. These sabbaths were sometimes
	held for one district, sometimes for another, and once at least every
	year it was held on the Brocken, or among other high mountains, as
	a general sabbath of the fiends for the whole of Christendom.</p>

	<p>The devil generally chose a place where four roads met as the
	scene of this assembly, or if that was not convenient, the neighbourhood
	of a lake. Upon this spot nothing would ever afterwards grow,
	as the hot feet of the demons and witches burnt the principle of fecundity
	from the earth, and rendered it barren for ever. When orders
	had been once issued for the meeting of the sabbath, all the wizards
	and witches who failed to attend it were lashed by demons with a rod
	made of serpents or scorpions, as a punishment for their inattention
	or want of punctuality.</p>

	<p>In France and England the witches were supposed to ride uniformly
	upon broomsticks; but in Italy and Spain, the devil himself, in
	the shape of a goat, used to transport them on his back, which lengthened
	or shortened according to the number of witches he was desirous
	of accommodating. No witch, when proceeding to the sabbath, could
	get out by a door or window, were she to try ever so much. Their
	general mode of ingress was by the keyhole, and of egress by the
	chimney, up which they flew, broom and all, with the greatest ease.
	To prevent the absence of the witches from being noticed by their
	neighbours, some inferior demon was commanded to assume their
	shapes and lie in their beds, feigning illness, until the sabbath was
	over.</p>

	<p>When all the wizards and witches had arrived at the place of
	rendezvous, the infernal ceremonies of the sabbath began. Satan,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"></a>having assumed his favourite shape of a large he-goat, with a face in
	front and another in his haunches, took his seat upon a throne; and
	all present, in succession, paid their respects to him, and kissed him in
	his face behind. This done, he appointed a master of the ceremonies,
	in company with whom he made a personal examination of all the
	wizards and witches, to see whether they had the secret mark about
	them by which they were stamped as the devil’s own. This mark
	was always insensible to pain. Those who had not yet been marked,
	received the mark from the master of the ceremonies, the devil at
	the same time bestowing nicknames upon them. This done, they all
	began to sing and dance in the most furious manner, until some one
	arrived who was anxious to be admitted into their society. They
	were then silent for a while, until the new-comer had denied his salvation,
	kissed the devil, spat upon the Bible, and sworn obedience to
	him in all things. They then began dancing again with all their
	might, and singing these words,</p>

	<div class="poem" lang="es" xml:lang="es">
		<p>“Alegremos, Alegremos!</p>
		<p>Que gente va tenemos!”</p>
	</div>

	<p>In the course of an hour or two they generally became wearied
	of this violent exercise, and then they all sat down and recounted the
	evil deeds they had done since their last meeting. Those who had
	not been malicious and mischievous enough towards their fellow-creatures,
	received personal chastisement from Satan himself, who
	flogged them with thorns or scorpions till they were covered with
	blood, and unable to sit or stand.</p>

	<p>When this ceremony was concluded, they were all amused by a
	dance of toads. Thousands of these creatures sprang out of the earth,
	and standing on their hind legs, danced, while the devil played the
	bagpipes or the trumpet. These toads were all endowed with the
	faculty of speech, and entreated the witches to reward them with the
	flesh of unbaptised babes for their exertions to give them pleasure.
	The witches promised compliance. The devil bade them remember
	to keep their word; and then stamping his foot, caused all the
	toads to sink into the earth in an instant. The place being thus
	cleared, preparation was made for the banquet, where all manner
	of disgusting things were served up and greedily devoured by the
	demons and witches; although the latter were sometimes regaled
	with choice meats and expensive wines from golden plates and
	crystal goblets; but they were never thus favoured unless they had
	done an extraordinary number of evil deeds since the last period of
	meeting.</p>

	<p>After the feast, they began dancing again; but such as had no
	relish for any more exercise in that way, amused themselves by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"></a>mocking the holy sacrament of baptism. For this purpose, the toads were
	again called up, and sprinkled with filthy water; the devil making
	the sign of the cross, and all the witches calling out, “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">In nomine
	Patricâ, Aragueaco Petrica, agora! agora! Valentia, jouando goure
	gaits goustia!</em>” which meant, “In the name of Patrick, Petrick of
	Aragon, now, now, all our ills are over!”</p>

	<p>When the devil wished to be particularly amused, he made the
	witches strip off their clothes and dance before him, each with a cat
	tied round her neck, and another dangling from her body in form of
	a tail. When the cock crew, they all disappeared, and the sabbath
	was ended.</p>

	<p>This is a summary of the belief which prevailed for many centuries
	nearly all over Europe, and which is far from eradicated even at this
	day. It was varied in some respects in several countries, but the
	main points were the same in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy,
	Spain, and the far North of Europe.</p>

	<p>The early annals of France abound with stories of supposed sorcery,
	but it was not until the time of Charlemagne that the crime
	acquired any great importance. “This monarch,” says M. Jules
	Garinet,<a href="#fn24" id="fnm24" title="Histoire de la Magie en France..." class="fnmarker">24</a> “had several times given orders that all necromancers, astrologers,
	and witches should be driven from his states; but as the
	number of criminals augmented daily, he found it necessary at last to
	resort to severer measures. In consequence, he published several
	edicts, which may be found at length in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitulaire de Baluse</cite>.
	By these, every sort of magic, enchantment, and witchcraft was forbidden;
	and the punishment of death decreed against those who in
	any way evoked the devil, compounded love-philters, afflicted either
	man or woman with barrenness, troubled the atmosphere, excited
	tempests, destroyed the fruits of the earth, dried up the milk of
	cows, or tormented their fellow-creatures with sores and diseases.
	All persons found guilty of exercising these execrable arts were to
	be executed immediately upon conviction, that the earth might be
	rid of the burden and curse of their presence; and those even who
	consulted them might also be punished with death.”<a href="#fn25" id="fnm25" title="Michaud, in his History of the Crusades..." class="fnmarker">25</a></p>

	<p>After this time, prosecutions for witchcraft are continually mentioned,
	especially by the French historians. It was a crime imputed
	with so much ease, and repelled with so much difficulty, that the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"></a>powerful, whenever they wanted to ruin the weak, and could fix no
	other imputation upon them, had only to accuse them of witchcraft
	to ensure their destruction. Instances in which this crime was made
	the pretext for the most violent persecution, both of individuals and
	of communities, whose real offences were purely political or religious,
	must be familiar to every reader. The extermination of the Stedinger
	in 1234, of the Templars from 1307 to 1313, the execution of Joan
	of Arc in 1429, and the unhappy scenes of Arras in 1459, are the
	most prominent. The first of these is perhaps the least known, but
	is not among the least remarkable. The following account, from Dr.
	Kortüm’s interesting history <a href="#fn26" id="fnm26" title="Entstehungsgeschichte..." class="fnmarker">26</a> of the republican confederacies of the
	middle ages, will shew the horrible convenience of imputations of
	witchcraft when royal or priestly wolves wanted a pretext for a quarrel
	with the sheep.</p>

	<p>The Frieslanders, inhabiting the district from the Weser to the
	Zuydersee, had long been celebrated for their attachment to freedom,
	and their successful struggles in its defence. As early as the eleventh
	century they had formed a general confederacy against the encroachments
	of the Normans and the Saxons, which was divided into seven
	<em>seelands</em>, holding annually a diet under a large oak-tree at Aurich,
	near the Upstalboom. Here they managed their own affairs, without
	the control of the clergy and ambitious nobles who surrounded them,
	to the great scandal of the latter. They already had true notions of
	a representative government. The deputies of the people levied the
	necessary taxes, deliberated on the affairs of the community, and performed,
	in their simple and patriarchal manner, nearly all the functions
	of the representative assemblies of the present day. Finally,
	the Archbishop of Bremen, together with the Count of Oldenburg and
	other neighbouring potentates, formed a league against that section
	of the Frieslanders known by the name of the Stedinger, and succeeded,
	after harassing them and sowing dissensions among them for
	many years, in bringing them under the yoke. But the Stedinger,
	devotedly attached to their ancient laws, by which they had attained
	a degree of civil and religious liberty very uncommon in that age, did
	not submit without a violent struggle. They arose in insurrection
	in the year 1204, in defence of the ancient customs of their country,
	refused to pay taxes to the feudal chiefs or tithes to the clergy—who
	had forced themselves into their peaceful retreats—and drove out
	many of their oppressors. For a period of eight-and-twenty years
	the brave Stedinger continued the struggle single-handed against the
	forces of the Archbishops of Bremen and the Counts of Oldenburg,
	and destroyed, in the year 1232, the strong castle of Slutterberg, near
	<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"></a>Delmenhorst, built by the latter nobleman as a position from which
	he could send out his marauders to plunder and destroy the possessions
	of the peasantry.</p>

	<p>The invincible courage of these poor people proving too strong for
	their oppressors to cope with by the ordinary means of warfare, the
	Archbishop of Bremen applied to Pope Gregory IX. for his spiritual
	aid against them. That prelate entered cordially into the cause, and
	launching forth his anathema against the Stedinger as heretics and
	witches, encouraged all true believers to assist in their extermination.
	A large body of thieves and fanatics broke into their country in the
	year 1233, killing and burning wherever they went, and not sparing
	either women or children, the sick or the aged, in their rage. The
	Stedinger, however, rallied in great force, routed their invaders, and
	killed in battle their leader, Count Burckhardt of Oldenburg, with
	many inferior chieftains.</p>

	<p>Again the pope was applied to, and a crusade against the Stedinger
	was preached in all that part of Germany. The pope wrote to all the
	bishops and leaders of the faithful an exhortation to arm, to root out
	from the land those abominable witches and wizards. “The Stedinger,”
	said his holiness, “seduced by the devil, have abjured all the
	laws of God and man, slandered the Church, insulted the holy sacraments,
	consulted witches to raise evil spirits, shed blood like water,
	taken the lives of priests, and concocted an infernal scheme to propagate
	the worship of the devil, whom they adore under the name of
	Asmodi. The devil appears to them in different shapes,—sometimes
	as a goose or a duck, and at others in the figure of a pale black-eyed
	youth, with a melancholy aspect, whose embrace fills their hearts
	with eternal hatred against the holy Church of Christ. This devil
	presides at their sabbaths, when they all kiss him and dance around
	him. He then envelopes them in total darkness, and they all, male
	and female, give themselves up to the grossest and most disgusting
	debauchery.”</p>

	<p>In consequence of these letters of the pope, the emperor of Germany,
	Frederic II., also pronounced his ban against them. The
	Bishops of Ratzebourg, Lubeck, Osnabrück, Munster, and Minden
	took up arms to exterminate them, aided by the Duke of Brabant,
	the Counts of Holland, of Clêves, of the Mark, of Oldenburg, of Egmond,
	of Diest, and many other powerful nobles. An army of forty
	thousand men was soon collected, which marched, under the command
	of the Duke of Brabant, into the country of the Stedinger. The
	latter mustered vigorously in defence of their lives and liberties, but
	could raise no greater force, including every man capable of bearing
	arms, than eleven thousand men to cope against the overwhelming
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"></a>numbers of their foe. They fought with the energy of despair, but
	all in vain. Eight thousand of them were slain on the field of battle;
	the whole race was exterminated; and the enraged conquerors scoured
	the country in all directions, slew the women and children and old
	men, drove away the cattle, fired the woods and cottages, and made
	a total waste of the land.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Just as absurd and effectual was the charge brought against the
	Templars in 1307, when they had rendered themselves obnoxious to
	the potentates and prelacy of Christendom. Their wealth, their
	power, their pride, and their insolence had raised up enemies on
	every side; and every sort of accusation was made against them, but
	failed to work their overthrow, until the terrible cry of witchcraft
	was let loose upon them. This effected its object, and the Templars
	were extirpated. They were accused of having sold their souls to the
	devil, and of celebrating all the infernal mysteries of the witches’
	sabbath. It was pretended that, when they admitted a novice into
	their order, they forced him to renounce his salvation and curse
	Jesus Christ; that they
	then made him submit to
	many unholy and disgusting
	ceremonies, and forced
	him to kiss the superior on
	the cheek, the navel, and
	the breech, and spit three
	times upon a crucifix; that
	all the members were forbidden
	to have connexion
	with women, but might
	give themselves up without
	restraint to every species
	of unmentionable debauchery;
	that when by
	any mischance a Templar
	infringed this order, and a
	child was born, the whole
	order met, and tossed it
	about like a shuttlecock
	from one to the other until
	it expired; that they then
	roasted it by a slow fire,
	and with the fat which
	trickled from it anointed the hair and beard of a large image of the
	devil. It was also said that when one of the knights died, his body
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"></a>was burnt into a powder, and then mixed with wine and drunk by
	every member of the order. Philip IV., who, to exercise his own
	implacable hatred, invented, in all probability, the greater part of
	these charges, issued orders for the immediate arrest of all the Templars
	in his dominions. The pope afterwards took up the cause with
	almost as much fervour as the king of France; and in every part of
	Europe the Templars were thrown into prison, and their goods and
	estates confiscated. Hundreds of them, when put to the rack, confessed
	even the most preposterous of the charges against them, and
	by so doing increased the popular clamour and the hopes of their enemies.
	It is true that, when removed from the rack, they denied all
	they had previously confessed; but this circumstance only increased
	the outcry, and was numbered as an additional crime against them.
	They were considered in a worse light than before, and condemned
	forthwith to the flames as relapsed heretics. Fifty-nine of these unfortunate
	victims were all burned together by a slow fire in a field in
	the suburbs of Paris, protesting to the very last moment of their lives
	their innocence of the crimes imputed to them, and refusing to accept
	of pardon upon condition of acknowledging themselves guilty. Similar
	scenes were enacted in the provinces; and for four years hardly a
	month passed without witnessing the execution of one or more of
	these unhappy men. Finally, in 1313, the last scene of this tragedy
	closed by the burning of the Grand-Master, Jacques de Molay, and
	his companion Guy, the commander of Normandy. Any thing more
	atrocious it is impossible to conceive,—disgraceful alike to the monarch
	who originated, the pope who supported, and the age which
	tolerated the monstrous iniquity. That the malice of a few could
	invent such a charge is a humiliating thought for the lover of his
	species; but that millions of mankind should credit it is still more
	so.</p>

	<p>The execution of Joan of Arc is the next most notorious example
	which history affords us of the imputation of witchcraft against a political
	enemy. Instances of similar persecution, in which this crime
	was made the pretext for the gratification of political or religious
	hatred, might be multiplied to a great extent. But it is better to
	proceed at once to the consideration of the bull of Pope Innocent, the
	torch that set fire to the long-laid train, and caused so fearful an
	explosion over the Christian world. It will be necessary, however, to
	go back for some years anterior to that event, the better to understand
	the motives that influenced the Church in the promulgation of
	that fearful document.</p>

	<p>Towards the close of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth
	century, many witches were burned in different parts of Europe. As
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"></a>a natural consequence of the severe persecution, the crime, or the
	pretenders to it, increased. Those who found themselves accused and
	threatened with the penalties, if they happened to be persons of a bad
	and malicious disposition, wished they had the power imputed to
	them, that they might be revenged upon their persecutors. Numerous
	instances are upon record of half-crazed persons being found muttering
	the spells which were supposed to raise the evil one. When
	religion and law alike recognised the crime, it is no wonder that the
	weak in reason and the strong in imagination, especially when they
	were of a nervous temperament, fancied themselves endued with the
	terrible powers of which all the world was speaking. The belief of
	their neighbours did not lag behind their own, and execution was the
	speedy consequence.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:180px;">

		<p class="caption">JOAN OF ARC.</p>
	</div>

	<p>As the fear of witchcraft increased, the Catholic clergy strove to
	fix the imputation of it upon those religious sects, the pioneers of the
	Reformation, who began about this time to be formidable to the
	Church of Rome. If a charge of heresy could not ensure their destruction,
	that of sorcery and witchcraft never failed. In the year
	1459, a devoted congregation of the Waldenses at Arras, who used to
	repair at night to worship God in their own manner in solitary places,
	fell victims to an accusation of sorcery. It was rumoured in Arras
	that in the desert places to which they retired the devil appeared before
	them in human form, and read from a large book his laws and
	ordinances, to which they all promised obedience; that he then distributed
	money and food among them, to bind them to his service,
	which done, they gave themselves up to every species of lewdness and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"></a>debauchery. Upon these rumours several creditable persons in Arras
	were seized and imprisoned, together with a number of decrepit and
	idiotic old women. The rack, that convenient instrument for making
	the accused confess any thing, was of course put in requisition. Monstrelet,
	in his chronicle, says that they were tortured until some of
	them admitted the truth of the whole accusations, and said, besides,
	that they had seen and recognised in their nocturnal assemblies many
	persons of rank; many prelates, seigneurs, governors of bailliages,
	and mayors of cities, being such names as the examiners had themselves
	suggested to the victims. Several who had been thus informed
	against were thrown into prison, and so horribly tortured, that reason
	fled, and in their ravings of pain they also confessed their midnight
	meetings with the devil, and the oaths they had taken to serve him.
	Upon these confessions judgment was pronounced. The poor old
	women, as usual in such cases, were hanged and burned in the market-place;
	the more wealthy delinquents were allowed to escape upon
	payment of large sums. It was soon after universally recognised that
	these trials had been conducted in the most odious manner, and that
	the judges had motives of private vengeance against many of the more
	influential persons who had been implicated. The parliament of Paris
	afterwards declared the sentence illegal, and the judges iniquitous;
	but its <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrêt</em> was too late to be of service even to those who had paid
	the fine, or to punish the authorities who had misconducted themselves,
	for it was not delivered until thirty-two years after the executions
	had taken place.</p>

	<p>In the mean time, accusations of witchcraft spread rapidly in
	France, Italy, and Germany. Strange to say, that although in the
	first instance chiefly directed against heretics, the latter were as firm
	believers in the crime as even the Catholics themselves. In after
	times we also find that the Lutherans and Calvinists became greater
	witch-burners than ever the Romanists had been, so deeply was the
	prejudice rooted. Every other point of belief was in dispute, but
	that was considered by every sect to be as well established as the
	authenticity of the Scriptures or the existence of a God.</p>

	<p>But at this early period of the epidemic the persecutions were
	directed by the heads of the Catholic Church. The spread of heresy
	betokened, it was thought, the coming of Antichrist. Florimond, in
	his work concerning Antichrist, exposed the secret of these prosecutions.
	He says: “All who have afforded us some signs of the
	approach of Antichrist agree that the increase of sorcery and witchcraft
	is to distinguish the melancholy period of his advent; and was
	ever age so afflicted as ours? The seats destined for criminals in
	our courts of justice are blackened with persons accused of this guilt.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"></a>There are not judges enough to try them. Our dungeons are gorged
	with them. No day passes that we do not render our tribunals bloody
	by the dooms which we pronounce, or in which we do not return to
	our homes discountenanced and terrified at the horrible confessions
	which we have heard. And the devil is accounted so good a master,
	that we cannot commit so great a number of his slaves to the flames
	but what there shall arise from their ashes a sufficient number to supply
	their place.”</p>

	<p>Florimond here spoke the general opinion of the Church of Rome;
	but it never suggested itself to the mind of any person engaged in
	these trials, that if it were indeed a devil who raised up so many new
	witches to fill the places of those consumed, it was no other than one
	in their own employ—the devil of persecution. But so it was. The
	more they burned, the more they found to burn, until it became a
	common prayer with women in the humbler walks of life, that they
	might never live to grow old. It was sufficient to be aged, poor, and
	half-crazed, to ensure death at the stake or the scaffold.</p>

		<p class="caption">GATE OF CONSTANCE.</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"></a>In the year 1487 there was a severe storm in Switzerland, which
	laid waste the country for four miles around Constance. Two wretched
	old women, whom the popular voice had long accused of witchcraft,
	were arrested on the preposterous charge of having raised the tempest.
	The rack was displayed, and the two poor creatures were extended
	upon it. In reply to various questions from their tormentors, they
	owned in their agony that they were in the constant habit of meeting
	the devil; that they had sold their souls to him; and that at their
	command he had raised the tempest. Upon this insane and blasphemous
	charge they were condemned to die. In the criminal registers
	of Constance there stands against the name of each the simple
	but significant phrase, “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">convicta et combusta</em>.”</p>

	<p>This case and hundreds of others were duly reported to the ecclesiastical
	powers. There happened at that time to be a pontiff at the
	head of the Church who had given much of his attention to the subject
	of witchcraft, and who, with the intention of rooting out the supposed
	crime, did more to increase it than any other man that ever lived.
	John Baptist Cibo, elected to the papacy in 1485, under the designation
	of Innocent VIII., was sincerely alarmed at the number of witches,
	and launched forth his terrible manifesto against them. In his celebrated
	bull of 1488, he called the nations of Europe to the rescue of
	the Church of Christ upon earth, imperilled by the arts of Satan, and
	set forth the horrors that had reached his ears; how that numbers
	of both sexes had intercourse with the infernal fiends; how by their
	sorceries they afflicted both man and beast; how they blighted the
	marriage-bed, destroyed the births of women and the increase of
	cattle; and how they blasted the corn on the ground, the grapes of
	the vineyard, the fruits of the trees, and the herbs of the field. In
	order that criminals so atrocious might no longer pollute the earth,
	he appointed inquisitors in every country, armed with the apostolic
	power to convict and punish.</p>

	<p>It was now that the <em>Witch Mania</em>, properly so called, may be said
	to have fairly commenced. Immediately a class of men sprang up in
	Europe, who made it the sole business of their lives to discover and
	burn the witches. Sprenger, in Germany, was the most celebrated
	of these national scourges. In his notorious work, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malleus Maleficarum</cite>,
	he laid down a regular form of trial, and appointed a course
	of examination by which the inquisitors in other countries might best
	discover the guilty. The questions, which were always enforced by
	torture, were of the most absurd and disgusting nature. The inquisitors
	were required to ask the suspected whether they had midnight
	meetings with the devil? whether they attended the witches’ sabbath
	on the Brocken? whether they had their familiar spirits? whether
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"></a>they could raise whirlwinds and call down the lightning? and whether
	they had had sexual intercourse with Satan?</p>

	<p>Straightway the inquisitors set to work: Cumanus, in Italy, burned
	forty-one poor women in one province alone; and Sprenger, in Germany,
	burned a number which can never be ascertained correctly,
	but which, it is agreed on all hands, amounted to more than five
	hundred in a year. The great resemblance between the confessions
	of the unhappy victims was regarded as a new proof of the existence
	of the crime. But this is not astonishing. The same questions from
	the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malleus Maleficarum</cite> were put to them all, and torture never failed
	to educe the answer required by the inquisitor. Numbers of people,
	whose imaginations were filled with these horrors, went further in the
	way of confession than even their tormentors anticipated, in the hope
	that they would thereby be saved from the rack, and put out of their
	misery at once. Some confessed that they had had children by the
	devil; but no one who had ever been a mother gave utterance to such
	a frantic imagining, even in the extremity of her anguish. The childless
	only confessed it, and were burned instanter as unworthy to live.</p>

	<p>For fear the zeal of the enemies of Satan should cool, successive
	popes appointed new commissions. One was appointed by Alexander
	VI. in 1494, another by Leo X. in 1521, and a third by Adrian VI.
	in 1522. They were all armed with the same powers to hunt out and
	destroy, and executed their fearful functions but too rigidly. In
	Geneva alone five hundred persons were burned in the years 1515 and
	1516, under the title of Protestant witches. It would appear that their
	chief crime was heresy, and their witchcraft merely an aggravation.
	Bartolomeo de Spina has a list still more fearful. He informs us
	that in the year 1524 no less than a thousand persons suffered death
	for witchcraft in the district of Como, and that for several years afterwards
	the average number of victims exceeded a hundred annually.
	One inquisitor, Remigius, took great credit to himself for having,
	during fifteen years, convicted and burned nine hundred.</p>

	<p>In France, about the year 1520, fires for the execution of witches
	blazed in almost every town. Danæus, in his <cite>Dialogues of Witches</cite>,
	says they were so numerous that it would be next to impossible to
	tell the number of them. So deep was the thraldom of the human
	mind, that the friends and relatives of the accused parties looked on
	and approved. The wife or sister of a murderer might sympathise in
	his fate, but the wives and husbands of sorcerers and witches had no
	pity. The truth is that pity was dangerous, for it was thought no one
	could have compassion on the sufferings of a witch who was not a
	dabbler in sorcery: to have wept for a witch would have insured the
	stake. In some districts, however, the exasperation of the people
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"></a>broke out, in spite of superstition. The inquisitor of a rural township
	in Piedmont burned the victims so plentifully and so fast, that
	there was not a family in the place which did not lose a member.
	The people at last arose, and the inquisitor was but too happy to
	escape from the country with whole limbs. The archbishop of the
	diocese proceeded afterwards to the trial of such as the inquisitor had
	left in prison.</p>

	<p>Some of the charges were so utterly preposterous that the poor
	wretches were at once liberated; others met a harder, but the usual
	fate. Some of them were accused of having joined the witches’ dance
	at midnight under a blasted oak, where they had been seen by creditable
	people. The husbands of several of these women (two of whom
	were young and beautiful) swore positively that at the time stated
	their wives were comfortably asleep in their arms; but it was all in vain.
	Their word was taken, but the archbishop told them they had been deceived
	by the devil and their
	own senses. It was true they
	might have had the semblance
	of their wives in their beds, but
	the originals were far away at
	the devil’s dance under the oak.
	The honest fellows were confounded,
	and their wives burned
	forthwith.</p>

	<p>In the year 1561, five poor
	women of Verneuil were accused
	of transforming themselves
	into cats, and in that
	shape attending the sabbath
	of the fiends—prowling around
	Satan, who presided over them
	in the form of a goat, and dancing,
	to amuse him, upon his
	back. They were found guilty,
	and burned.<a href="#fn27" id="fnm27" title="Bodin..." class="fnmarker">27</a></p>

	<p>In 1564, three wizards and
	a witch appeared before the
	Presidents Salvert and D’Avanton:
	they confessed, when
	extended on the rack, that
	they anointed the sheep-pens with infernal unguents to kill the
	sheep; that they attended the sabbath, where they saw a great black
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"></a>goat, which spoke to them, and made them kiss him, each holding
	a lighted candle in his hand while he performed the ceremony.
	They were all executed at Poitiers.</p>

	<p>In 1571 the celebrated sorcerer Trois Echelles was burned in the
	Place de Grève in Paris. He confessed, in the presence of Charles IX.,
	and of the Marshals de Montmorency, De Retz, and the Sieur du
	Mazille, physician to the king, that he could perform the most wonderful
	things by the aid of a devil to whom he had sold himself. He
	described at great length the saturnalia of the fiends, the sacrifices
	which they offered up, the debaucheries they committed with the
	young and handsome witches, and the various modes of preparing
	the infernal unguent for blighting cattle. He said he had upwards
	of twelve hundred accomplices in the crime of witchcraft in various
	parts of France, whom he named to the king, and many of whom
	were afterwards arrested and suffered execution.</p>

	<p>At Dôle, two years afterwards, Gilles Garnier, a native of Lyons,
	was indicted for being a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loup-garou</em>, or man-wolf, and for prowling in
	that shape about the country at night to devour little children. The
	indictment against him, as read by Henri Camus, doctor of laws and
	counsellor of the king, was to the effect that he, Gilles Garnier, had
	seized upon a little girl, twelve years of age, whom he drew into a
	vineyard and there killed, partly with his teeth and partly with his
	hands, seeming like wolf’s paws; that from thence he trailed her
	bleeding body along the ground with his teeth into the wood of La
	Serre, where he ate the greatest portion of her at one meal, and carried
	the remainder home to his wife; that upon another occasion,
	eight days before the festival of All Saints, he was seen to seize another
	child in his teeth, and would have devoured her had she not
	been rescued by the country people, and that the said child died a
	few days afterwards of the injuries he had inflicted; that fifteen days
	after the same festival of All Saints, being again in the shape of a
	wolf, he devoured a boy thirteen years of age, having previously torn
	off his leg and thigh with his teeth, and hid them away for his breakfast
	on the morrow. He was furthermore indicted for giving way
	to the same diabolical and unnatural propensities even in his shape
	of a man; and that he had strangled a boy in a wood with the intention
	of eating him, which crime he would have effected if he had not
	been seen by the neighbours and prevented.</p>

	<p>Gilles Garnier was put to the rack after fifty witnesses had deposed
	against him. He confessed every thing that was laid to his charge.
	He was thereupon brought back into the presence of his judges, when
	Dr. Camus, in the name of the parliament of Dôle, pronounced the
	following sentence:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"></a>“Seeing that Gilles Garnier has, by the testimony of credible witnesses,
		and by his own spontaneous confession, been proved guilty of
		the abominable crimes of lycanthropy and witchcraft, this court condemns
		him, the said Gilles, to be this day taken in a cart from this
		spot to the place of execution, accompanied by the executioner (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
		exécuteur de la haute justice</em>), where he, by the said executioner, shall
		be tied to a stake and burned alive, and that his ashes be then scattered
		to the winds. The court further condemns him, the said Gilles,
		to the costs of this prosecution.”</p>

		<p>“Given at Dôle, this 18th day of January, 1573.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>In 1578, the parliament of Paris was occupied for several days with
	the trial of a man named Jacques Rollet. He also was found guilty
	of being a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loup-garou</em>, and in that shape devouring a little boy. He
	was burnt alive in the Place de Grève.</p>

	<p>In 1579, so much alarm was excited in the neighbourhood of
	Melun by the increase of witches and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loup-garous</em>, that a council was
	held to devise some measures to stay the evil. A decree was passed
	that all witches and consulters with witches should be punished with
	death; and not only those, but fortune-tellers and conjurors of every
	kind. The parliament of Rouen took up the same question in the
	following year, and decreed that the possession of a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grimoire</em>, or book
	of spells, was sufficient evidence of witchcraft, and that all persons
	on whom such books were found should be burned alive. Three
	councils were held in different parts of France in the year 1583, all in
	relation to the same subject. The parliament of Bourdeaux issued
	strict injunctions to all curates and clergy whatever to use redoubled
	efforts to root out the crime of witchcraft. The parliament of Tours
	was equally peremptory, and feared the judgments of an offended God
	if all these dealers with the devil were not swept from the face of the
	land. The parliament of Rheims was particularly severe against the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noueurs d’aiguillette</em>, or “tyers of the knot”—people of both sexes
	who took pleasure in preventing the consummation of marriage, that
	they might counteract the command of God to our first parents to
	increase and multiply. This parliament held it to be sinful to wear
	amulets to preserve from witchcraft; and that this practice might not
	be continued within its jurisdiction, drew up a form of exorcism,
	which would more effectually defeat the agents of the devil, and put
	them to flight.</p>

	<p>A case of witchcraft, which created a great sensation in its day,
	occurred in 1588, at a village in the mountains of Auvergne, about
	two leagues from Apchon. A gentleman of that place being at his
	window, there passed a friend of his who had been out hunting, and
	who was then returning to his own house. The gentleman asked his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"></a>friend what sport he had had; upon which the latter informed him
	that he had been attacked in the plain by a large and savage wolf,
	which he had shot at without wounding, and that he had then drawn
	out his hunting-knife and cut off the animal’s fore-paw as it sprang
	upon his neck to devour him. The huntsman upon this put his hand
	into his bag to pull out the paw, but was shocked to find that it was
	a woman’s hand, with a wedding-ring on the finger. The gentleman
	immediately recognised his wife’s ring, “which,” says the indictment
	against her, “made him begin to suspect some evil of her.” He immediately
	went in search of her, and found her sitting by the fire in
	the kitchen, with her arm hidden underneath her apron. He tore off
	her apron with great vehemence, and found that she had no hand,
	and that the stump was even then bleeding. She was given into
	custody, and burnt at Riom in presence of some thousands of spectators.<a href="#fn28" id="fnm28" title="Tablier. See also..." class="fnmarker">28</a></p>

	<p>In the midst of these executions, rare were the gleams of mercy.
	Few instances are upon record of any acquittal taking place when the
	crime was witchcraft. The discharge of fourteen persons by the parliament
	of Paris, in the year 1589, is almost a solitary example of a
	return to reason. Fourteen persons condemned to death for witchcraft
	appealed against the judgment to the parliament of Paris, which
	for political reasons had been exiled to Tours. The parliament named
	four commissioners—Pierre Pigray, the king’s surgeon, and Messieurs
	Leroi, Renard, and Falaiseau, the king’s physicians—to visit and
	examine these witches, and see whether they had the mark of the
	devil upon them. Pigray, who relates the circumstance in his work
	on Surgery (book vii. chap. 10), says the visit was made in presence
	of two counsellors of the court. The witches were all stripped
	naked, and the physicians examined their bodies very diligently,
	pricking them in all the marks they could find to see whether they
	were insensible to pain, which was always considered a certain proof
	of guilt. They were, however, very sensible of the pricking, and
	some of them called out very lustily when the pins were driven into
	them. “We found them,” continues Pierre Pigray, “to be very
	poor, stupid people, and some of them insane. Many of them were
	quite indifferent about life, and one or two of them desired death as
	a relief for their sufferings. Our opinion was, that they stood more
	in need of medicine than of punishment; and so we reported to the
	parliament. Their case was thereupon taken into further consideration;
	and the parliament, after mature counsel amongst all the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"></a>members, ordered the poor creatures to be sent to their homes, without
	inflicting any punishment upon them.”</p>

	<p>Such was the dreadful state of Italy, Germany, and France during
	the sixteenth century, which was far from being the worst crisis of
	the popular madness with regard to witchcraft. Let us see what was
	the state of England during the same period. The Reformation,
	which in its progress had rooted out so many errors, stopped short at
	this, the greatest error of all. Luther and Calvin were as firm believers
	in witchcraft as Pope Innocent himself; and their followers
	shewed themselves more zealous persecutors than the Romanists. Dr.
	Hutchinson, in his work on Witchcraft, asserts that the mania manifested
	itself later in England, and raged with less virulence than on
	the continent. The first assertion only is true; for though the persecution
	began later both in England and Scotland, its progress was
	as fearful as elsewhere.</p>

	<p>It was not until more than fifty years after the issuing of the bull
	of Innocent VIII. that the legislature of England thought fit to make
	any more severe enactments against sorcery than those already in
	operation. The statute of 1541 was the first that specified the particular
	crime of witchcraft. At a much earlier period many persons
	had suffered death for sorcery, in addition to other offences; but no
	executions took place for attending the witches’ sabbath, raising
	tempests, afflicting cattle with barrenness, and all the fantastic trumpery
	of the continent. Two statutes were passed in 1551: the first
	relating to false prophecies, caused mainly, no doubt, by the impositions
	of Elizabeth Barton, the holy maid of Kent, in 1534; and the
	second against conjuration, witchcraft, and sorcery. But even this
	enactment did not consider witchcraft as penal in itself, and only condemned
	to death those who, by means of spells, incantations, or contracts
	with the devil, attempted the lives of their neighbours. The
	statute of Elizabeth, in 1562, at last recognised witchcraft as a crime
	of the highest magnitude, whether exerted or not to the injury of the
	lives, limbs, and possessions of the community. From that date the
	persecution may be fairly said to have commenced in England. It
	reached its climax in the early part of the seventeenth century, which
	was the hottest period of the mania all over Europe.</p>

	<p>A few cases of witch persecution in the sixteenth century will
	enable the reader to form a more accurate idea of the progress of this
	great error than if he plunged at once into that busy period of its
	history when Matthew Hopkins and his coadjutors exercised their
	infernal calling. Several instances occur in England during the latter
	years of the reign of Elizabeth. At this time the public mind
	had become pretty familiar with the details of the crime. Bishop
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"></a>Jewell, in his sermons before her majesty, used constantly to conclude
	them by a fervent prayer that she might be preserved from
	witches. Upon one occasion, in 1598, his words were, “It may
	please your grace to understand
	that witches and sorcerers within
	these last four years are marvellously
	increased within this
	your grace’s realm. Your grace’s
	subjects pine away even unto the
	death; their colour fadeth—their
	flesh rotteth—their speech is benumbed—their
	senses are bereft!
	I pray God they may never practise
	further than upon the <em>subject</em>!”</p>

	<p>By degrees, an epidemic terror
	of witchcraft spread into the villages.
	In proportion as the doctrine
	of the Puritans took root,
	this dread increased, and, of
	course, brought persecution in
	its train. The Church of England
	has claimed, and is entitled
	to the merit, of having been less
	influenced in these matters than any other sect of Christians; but
	still they were tainted with the superstition of the age. One of the
	most flagrant instances of cruelty and delusion upon record was consummated
	under the authority of the Church, and commemorated
	till a very late period by an annual lecture at the University of Cambridge.</p>

	<p>This is the celebrated case of the witches of Warbois, who were
	executed about thirty-two years after the passing of the statute of
	Elizabeth. Although in the interval but few trials are recorded,
	there is, unfortunately, but too much evidence to shew the extreme
	length to which the popular prejudice was carried. Many women
	lost their lives in every part of England without being brought to
	trial at all, from the injuries received at the hands of the people.
	The number of these can never be ascertained.</p>

	<p>The case of the witches of Warbois merits to be detailed at
	length, not only from the importance attached to it for so many
	years by the learned of the University, but from the singular absurdity
	of the evidence upon which men, sensible in all other respects,
	could condemn their fellow-creatures to the scaffold.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"></a>The principal actors in this strange drama were the families of
	Sir Samuel Cromwell and a Mr. Throgmorton, both gentlemen of
	landed property near Warbois in the county of Huntingdon. Mr.
	Throgmorton had several daughters, the eldest of whom, Mistress
	Joan, was an imaginative and melancholy girl, whose head was filled
	with stories of ghosts and witches. Upon one occasion she chanced
	to pass the cottage of one Mrs., or, as she was called, Mother Samuel,
	a very aged, a very poor, and a very ugly woman. Mother Samuel
	was sitting at her door knitting, with a black cap upon her head,
	when this silly young lady passed, and taking her eyes from her
	work she looked stedfastly at her. Mistress Joan immediately fancied
	that she felt sudden pains in all her limbs, and from that day
	forth never ceased to tell her sisters, and every body about her, that
	Mother Samuel had bewitched her. The other children took up the
	cry, and actually frightened themselves into fits whenever they passed
	within sight of this terrible old woman.</p>

	<p>Mr. and Mrs. Throgmorton, not a whit wiser than their children,
	believed all the absurd tales they had been told; and Lady Cromwell,
	a gossip of Mrs. Throgmorton, made herself very active in the
	business, and determined to bring the witch to the ordeal. The
	sapient Sir Samuel joined in the scheme; and the children, thus encouraged,
	gave loose reins to their imaginations, which seem to have
	been of the liveliest. They soon invented a whole host of evil spirits,
	and names for them besides, which they said were sent by Mother
	Samuel to torment them continually. Seven spirits especially, they
	said, were raised from hell by this wicked woman to throw them into
	fits; and as the children were actually subject to fits, their mother
	and her commeres gave the more credit to the story. The names
	of these spirits were, “First Smack,” “Second Smack,” “Third
	Smack,” “Blue,” “Catch,” “Hardname,” and “Pluck.”</p>

	<p>Throgmorton, the father, was so pestered by these idle fancies,
	and yet so well inclined to believe them, that he marched valiantly
	forth to the hut where Mother Samuel resided with her husband and
	daughter, and dragged her forcibly into his own grounds. Lady
	Cromwell, Mrs. Throgmorton, and the girls were in waiting, armed
	with long pins to prick the witch, and see if they could draw blood
	from her. Lady Cromwell, who seems to have been the most violent
	of the party, tore the old woman’s cap off her head, and plucking
	out a handful of her grey hair, gave it to Mrs. Throgmorton to burn,
	as a charm which would preserve them all from her future machinations.
	It was no wonder that the poor creature, subjected to this
	rough usage, should give vent to an involuntary curse upon her tormentors.
	She did so, and her curse was never forgotten. Her hair,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"></a>however, was supposed to be a grand specific, and she was allowed to
	depart, half dead with terror and ill-usage. For more than a year
	the families of Cromwell and Throgmorton continued to persecute
	her, and to assert that her imps afflicted them with pains and fits,
	turned the milk sour in their pans, and prevented their cows and
	ewes from bearing. In the midst of these fooleries, Lady Cromwell
	was taken ill and died. It was then remembered that her death had
	taken place exactly a year and a quarter since she was cursed by Mother
	Samuel, and that on several occasions she had dreamed of the
	witch and a black cat, the latter being of course the arch-enemy of
	mankind himself.</p>

	<p>Sir Samuel Cromwell now conceived himself bound to take more
	energetic measures against the sorceress, since he had lost his wife by
	her means. The year and a quarter and the black cat were proofs
	positive. All the neighbours had taken up the cry of witchcraft
	against Mother Samuel; and her personal appearance, unfortunately
	for her, the very ideal of what a witch ought to be, increased the popular
	suspicion. It would appear that at last the poor woman believed,
	even to her own disadvantage, that she was what every body represented
	her to be. Being forcibly brought into Mr. Throgmorton’s
	house, when his daughter Joan was in one of her customary fits, she
	was commanded by him and Sir Samuel Cromwell to expel the devil
	from the young lady. She was told to repeat her exorcism, and to
	add, “as I am a witch, and the causer of Lady Cromwell’s death, I
	charge thee, fiend, to come out of her!” She did as was required
	of her; and moreover confessed that her husband and daughter were
	leagued with her in witchcraft, and had, like her, sold their souls to
	the devil. The whole family were immediately arrested, and sent
	to Huntingdon to prison.</p>

	<p>The trial was instituted shortly afterwards before Mr. Justice Fenner,
	when all the crazy girls of Mr. Throgmorton’s family gave evidence
	against Mother Samuel and her family. They were all three
	put to the torture. The old woman confessed in her anguish that
	she was a witch; that she had cast her spells upon the young ladies;
	and that she had caused the death of Lady Cromwell. The father
	and daughter, stronger in mind than their unfortunate wife and
	parent, refused to confess any thing, and asserted their innocence to
	the last. They were all three condemned to be hanged, and their
	bodies burned. The daughter, who was young and good-looking, excited
	the pity of many persons, and she was advised to plead pregnancy,
	that she might gain at least a respite from death. The poor
	girl refused proudly, on the ground that she would not be accounted
	both a witch and a strumpet. Her half-witted old mother caught at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"></a>the idea of a few weeks’ longer life, and asserted that she was pregnant.
	The court was convulsed with laughter, in which the wretched
	victim herself joined; and this was accounted an additional proof
	that she was a witch. The whole family were executed on the 7th
	of April, 1593.</p>

	<p>Sir Samuel Cromwell, as lord of the manor, received the sum of
	40<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> out of the confiscated property of the Samuels, which he turned
	into a rent-charge of 40<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> yearly, for the endowment of an annual
	sermon or lecture upon the enormity of witchcraft, and this case in
	particular, to be preached by a doctor or bachelor of divinity of
	Queen’s College, Cambridge. I have not been able to ascertain the
	exact date at which this annual lecture was discontinued; but it
	appears to have been preached so late as 1718, when Dr. Hutchinson
	published his work upon witchcraft.</p>

	<p>To carry on in proper chronological order the history of the witch
	delusion in the British isles, it will be necessary to examine into what
	was taking place in Scotland during all that part of the sixteenth
	century anterior to the accession of James VI. to the crown of England.
	We naturally expect that the Scotch—a people renowned from
	the earliest times for their powers of imagination—should be more
	deeply imbued with this gloomy superstition than their neighbours of
	the south. The nature of their soil and climate tended to encourage
	the dreams of early ignorance. Ghosts, goblins, wraiths, kelpies, and
	a whole host of spiritual beings, were familiar to the dwellers by the
	misty glens of the Highlands and the romantic streams of the Lowlands.
	Their deeds, whether of good or ill, were enshrined in song,
	and took a greater hold upon the imagination because “verse had
	sanctified them.” But it was not till the religious reformers began
	the practice of straining Scripture to the severest extremes that the
	arm of the law was called upon to punish witchcraft as a crime <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</em>.
	What Pope Innocent VIII. had done for Germany and France, the
	preachers of the Reformation did for the Scottish people. Witchcraft,
	instead of being a mere article of faith, became enrolled in the statute-book;
	and all good subjects and true Christians were called upon to
	take arms against it. The ninth parliament of Queen Mary passed an
	act in 1563, which decreed the punishment of death against witches
	and consulters with witches, and immediately the whole bulk of the
	people were smitten with an epidemic fear of the devil and his mortal
	agents. Persons in the highest ranks of life shared and encouraged
	the delusion of the vulgar. Many were themselves accused of
	witchcraft; and noble ladies were shewn to have dabbled in mystic
	arts, and proved to the world that if they were not witches, it was
	not for want of the will.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"></a>Among the dames who became notorious for endeavouring to effect
	their wicked ends by the devil’s aid may be mentioned the celebrated
	Lady Buccleugh of Branxholme (familiar to all the readers of Sir
	Walter Scott), the Countess of Lothian, the Countess of Angus, the
	Countess of Athol, Lady Kerr, the Countess of Huntley, Euphemia
	Macalzean (the daughter of Lord Cliftonhall), and Lady Fowlis.
	Among the celebrated of the other sex who were accused of wizardism
	was Sir Lewis Ballantyne, the Lord Justice-Clerk for Scotland, who,
	if we may believe Scot of Scotstarvet, “dealt by curiosity with a
	warlock called Richard Grahame,” and prayed him to raise the devil.
	The warlock consented, and raised him <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</em> in the
	yard of his house in the Canongate, “at sight of whom the Lord
	Justice-Clerk was so terrified, that he took sickness and thereof died.”
	By such idle reports as these did the envious ruin the reputation of
	those they hated; though it would appear in this case that Sir Lewis
	had been fool enough to make the attempt of which he was accused,
	and that the success of the experiment was the only apocryphal part
	of the story.</p>

		<p class="caption">JOHN KNOX.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The enemies of John Knox invented a similar tale, which found
	ready credence among the Roman Catholics, glad to attach any stigma
	to that grand scourge of the vices of their Church. It was reported
	<a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"></a>that he and his secretary went into the churchyard of St. Andrew’s
	with the intent to raise “some sanctes;” but that, by a mistake in
	their conjurations, they raised the great fiend himself instead of the
	saints they wished to consult. The popular rumour added, that
	Knox’s secretary was so frightened at the great horns, goggle eyes,
	and long tail of Satan, that he went mad, and shortly afterwards
	died. Knox himself was built of sterner stuff, and was not to be
	frightened.</p>

	<p>The first name that occurs in the records of the High Court of
	Justiciary of persons tried or executed for witchcraft, is that of Janet
	Bowman in 1572, nine years after the passing of the act of Mary. No
	particulars of her crimes are given, and against her name there only
	stands the words, “convict and brynt.” It is not, however, to be
	inferred, that in this interval no trials or executions took place; for
	it appears, on the authority of documents of unquestioned authenticity
	in the Advocates’ Library at Edinburgh,<a href="#fn29" id="fnm29" title="Foreign Quarterly Review..." class="fnmarker">29</a> that the Privy Council
	made a practice of granting commissions to resident gentlemen and
	ministers in every part of Scotland to examine, try, and execute
	witches within their own parishes. No records of those who suffered
	from the sentence of these tribunals have been preserved; but if popular
	tradition may be believed even to the amount of one-fourth of its
	assertions, their number was fearful. After the year 1572, the entries
	of executions for witchcraft in the records of the High Court become
	more frequent, but do not average more than one per annum,—another
	proof that trials for this offence were in general entrusted to
	the local magistracy. The latter appear to have ordered witches to
	the stake with as little compunction, and after as summary a mode,
	as modern justices of the peace order a poacher to the stocks.</p>

	<p>As James VI. advanced in manhood, he took great interest in the
	witch trials. One of them especially—that of Gellie Duncan, Dr.
	Fian, and their accomplices, in the year 1591—engrossed his whole
	attention, and no doubt suggested in some degree the famous work
	on Demonology, which he wrote shortly afterwards. As these witches
	had made an attempt upon his own life, it is not surprising, with his
	habits, that he should have watched the case closely, or become
	strengthened in his prejudice and superstition by its singular details.
	No other trial that could be selected would give so fair an idea of the
	delusions of the Scottish people as this. Whether we consider the
	number of victims, the absurdity of the evidence, and the real villany
	of some of the persons implicated, it is equally extraordinary.</p>

	<p>Gellie Duncan, the prime witch in these proceedings, was servant
	to the deputy bailiff of Tranent, a small town in Haddingtonshire,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"></a>about ten miles from Edinburgh. Though neither old nor ugly (as
	witches usually were), but young and good-looking, her neighbours,
	from some suspicious parts of her behaviour, had long considered her
	a witch. She had, it appears, some pretensions to the healing art.
	Some cures which she effected were so sudden, that the worthy bailiff,
	her master, who, like his neighbours, mistrusted her, considered
	them no less than miraculous. In order to discover the truth, he
	put her to the torture; but she obstinately refused to confess that
	she had dealings with the devil. It was the popular belief that no
	witch would confess as long as the mark which Satan had put upon
	her remained undiscovered upon her body. Somebody present reminded
	the torturing bailie of this fact, and on examination, the
	devil’s mark was found upon the throat of poor Gellie. She was put
	to the torture again, and her fortitude giving way under the extremity
	of her anguish, she confessed that she was indeed a witch—that
	she had sold her soul to the devil, and effected all her cures by
	his aid. This was something new in the witch creed, according to
	which, the devil delighted more in laying diseases on than in taking
	them off; but Gellie Duncan fared no better on that account. The
	torture was still applied, until she had named all her accomplices,
	among whom were one Cunningham, a reputed wizard, known by
	the name of Dr. Fian; a grave and matron-like witch, named Agnes
	Sampson; Euphemia Macalzean, the daughter of Lord Cliftonhall,
	already mentioned, and nearly forty other persons, some of whom
	were the wives of respectable individuals in the city of Edinburgh.
	Every one of these persons was arrested, and the whole realm of
	Scotland thrown into commotion by the extraordinary nature of the
	disclosures which were anticipated.</p>

	<p>About two years previous to this time, James had suddenly left his
	kingdom, and proceeded gallantly to Denmark, to fetch over his bride,
	the Princess of Denmark, who had been detained by contrary weather
	in the harbour of Upslo. After remaining for some months in
	Copenhagen, he set sail with his young bride, and arrived safely in
	Leith, on the 1st of May 1590, having experienced a most boisterous
	passage, and been nearly wrecked. As soon as the arrest of Gellie
	Duncan and Fian became known in Scotland, it was reported by
	every body who pretended to be well-informed, that these witches
	and their associates had, by the devil’s means, raised the storms
	which had endangered the lives of the king and queen. Gellie, in
	her torture, had confessed that such was the fact, and the whole
	kingdom waited aghast and open-mouthed for the corroboration about
	to be furnished by the trial.</p>

	<p>Agnes Sampson, the “grave and matron-like” witch implicated
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"></a>by Gellie Duncan, was put to the horrible torture of the <em>pilliewinkis</em>.
	She laid bare all the secrets of the sisterhood before she had suffered
	an hour, and confessed that Gellie Duncan, Dr. Fian, Marian Lincup,
	Euphemia Macalzean, herself, and upwards of two hundred
	witches and warlocks, used to assemble at midnight in the kirk of
	North Berwick, where they met the devil; that they had plotted there
	to attempt the king’s life; that they were incited to this by the old
	fiend himself, who had asserted with a thundering oath that James was
	the greatest enemy he ever had, and that there would be no peace for
	the devil’s children upon earth until he were got rid of; that the devil
	upon these occasions always liked to have a little music, and that
	Gellie Duncan used to play a reel before him on a trump or Jew’s
	harp, to which all the witches danced.</p>

	<p>James was highly flattered at the idea that the devil should have
	said that he was the greatest enemy he ever had. He sent for Gellie
	Duncan to the palace, and made her play before him the same reel
	which she had played at the witches’ dance in the kirk.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:198px;">

		<p class="caption">TORTURE OF THE BOOTS.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Dr. Fian, or rather Cunningham, a petty schoolmaster of Tranent,
	was put to the torture among the rest. He was a man who
	had led an infamous life, was a compounder of and dealer in poisons,
	and a pretender to magic. Though not guilty of the preposterous
	crimes laid to his charge, there is no doubt that he was a sorcerer in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"></a>will, though not in deed, and that he deserved all the misery he endured.
	When put on the rack, he would confess nothing, and held
	out so long unmoved, that the severe torture of the <em>boots</em> was resolved
	upon. He endured this till exhausted nature could bear no longer,
	when insensibility kindly stepped in to his aid. When it was seen
	that he was utterly powerless, and that his tongue cleaved to the
	roof of his mouth, he was released. Restoratives were administered;
	and during the first faint gleam of returning consciousness, he was
	prevailed upon to sign, ere he well knew what he was about, a
	full confession, in strict accordance with those of Gellie Duncan and
	Agnes Sampson. He was then remanded to his prison, from which,
	after two days, he managed, some how or other, to escape. He was
	soon recaptured, and brought before the Court of Justiciary, James
	himself being present. Fian now denied all the circumstances of the
	written confession which he had signed; whereupon the king, enraged
	at his “stubborn wilfulness,” ordered him once more to the
	torture. His finger nails were riven out with pincers, and long needles
	thrust up to the eye into the quick; but he did not wince. He
	was then consigned again to the <em>boots</em>, in which, to quote a pamphlet
	published at the time,<a href="#fn30" id="fnm30" title="News from Scotland..." class="fnmarker">30</a> he continued “so long, and abode so many
	blows in them, that his legs were crushed and beaten together as
	small as might be, and the bones and flesh so bruised, that the blood
	and marrow spouted forth in great abundance, whereby they were
	made unserviceable for ever.”</p>

	<p>The astonishing similarity of the confessions of all the persons implicated
	in these proceedings has often been remarked. It would
	appear that they actually endeavoured to cause the king’s death by
	their spells and sorceries. Fian, who was acquainted with all the
	usual tricks of his profession, deceived them with pretended apparitions,
	so that many of them were really convinced that they had
	seen the devil. The sum of their confessions was to the following
	effect:</p>

	<p>Satan, who was, of course, a great foe of the reformed religion,
	was alarmed that King James should marry a Protestant princess.
	To avert the consequences to the realms of evil, he had determined
	to put an end to the king and his bride by raising a storm on their
	voyage home. Satan, first of all, sent a thick mist over the waters,
	in the hope that the king’s vessel might be stranded on the coast
	amid the darkness. This failing, Dr. Fian, who, from his superior
	scholarship, was advanced to the dignity of the devil’s secretary, was
	commanded to summon all the witches to meet their master, each one
	sailing on a sieve on the high seas.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"></a>On All Hallowmas Eve, they assembled to the number of upwards
	of two hundred, including Gellie Duncan, Agnes Sampson, Euphemia
	Macalzean, one Barbara Napier, and several warlocks; and each embarking
	in a riddle or sieve, they sailed “over the ocean very substantially.”
	After cruising about for some time, they met with the
	fiend, bearing in his claws a cat, which had been previously drawn
	nine times through the fire. This he delivered to one of the warlocks,
	telling him to cast it into the sea and cry “Hola!” This was done
	with all solemnity, and immediately the ocean became convulsed, the
	waters hissed loudly, and the waves rose mountains high,</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Twisting their arms to the dun-coloured heaven.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">The witches sailed gallantly through the tempest they had raised, and
	landing on the coast of Scotland, took their sieves in their hands and
	marched on in procession to the haunted kirk of North Berwick, where
	the devil had resolved to hold a preaching. Gellie Duncan, the musician
	of the party, tripped on before, playing on her Jew’s harp and
	singing,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Cummer, go ye before, cummer, go ye;</p>
		<p>Gif ye will not go before, cummer, let me!”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Arrived at the kirk, they paced around it <em>withershins</em>, that is, in reverse
	of the apparent motion of the sun. Dr. Fian then blew into the keyhole
	of the door, which opened immediately, and all the witches entered.
	As it was pitch dark, Fian blew with his mouth upon the
	candles, which immediately lighted, and the devil was seen occupying
	the pulpit. He was attired in a black gown and hat, and the witches
	saluted him by crying “All hail, master!” His body was hard, like
	iron; his face terrible; his nose, like the beak of an eagle; he had
	great burning eyes; his hands and legs were hairy; and he had long
	claws upon his hands and feet, and spake with an exceedingly gruff
	voice. Before commencing his sermon he called over the names of
	his congregation, demanding whether they had been good servants,
	and what success had attended their operations against the life of the
	king and his bride.</p>

	<p>Gray Meill, a crazy old warlock, who acted as beadle or door-keeper,
	was silly enough to answer “that nothing ailed the king yet,
	God be thanked;” upon which the devil, in a rage, stepped down
	from the pulpit and boxed his ears for him. He then remounted and
	commenced the preaching, commanding them to be dutiful servants
	to him and do all the evil they could. Euphemia Macalzean and
	Agnes Sampson, bolder than the rest, asked him whether he had
	brought the image or picture of King James, that they might, by
	pricking it, cause pains and diseases to fall upon him. “The father
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"></a>of lies” spoke truth for once, and confessed that he had forgotten it;
	upon which Euphemia Macalzean upbraided him loudly for his carelessness.
	The devil, however, took it all in good part, although
	Agnes Sampson and several other women let loose their tongues at
	him immediately. When they had done scolding, he invited them all
	to a grand entertainment. A newly buried corpse was dug up and
	divided among them, which was all they had in the way of edibles.
	He was more liberal in the matter of drink, and gave them so much
	excellent wine that they soon became jolly. Gellie Duncan then
	played the old tune upon her trump, and the devil himself led off the
	dance with Euphemia Macalzean. Thus they kept up the sport till
	the cock crew.</p>

		<p class="caption">JAMES THE DEMONOLOGIST.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Agnes Sampson, the wise woman of Keith, as she was called,
	added some other particulars in her confession. She stated, that on
	a previous occasion, she had
	raised an awful tempest in
	the sea by throwing a cat
	into it, with four joints of
	men tied to its feet. She
	said also, that on their grand
	attempt to drown King
	James, they did not meet
	with the devil after cruising
	about, but that he had accompanied
	them from the
	first, and that she had seen
	him dimly in the distance,
	rolling himself before them
	over the great waves, in
	shape and size not unlike a
	huge haystack. They met
	with a foreign ship richly
	laden with wines and other
	good things, which they boarded, and sunk after they had drunk all
	the wine and made themselves quite merry.</p>

	<p>Some of these disclosures were too much even for the abundant
	faith of King James, and he more than once exclaimed, that the
	witches were like their master, “extreme lyars.” But they confessed
	many other things of a less preposterous nature, and of which they
	were no doubt really guilty. Agnes Sampson said she was to have
	taken the king’s life by anointing his linen with a strong poison.
	Gellie Duncan used to threaten her neighbours by saying she would
	send the devil after them; and many persons of weaker minds than
	<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"></a>usual were frightened into fits by her, and rendered subject to them
	for the remainder of their lives. Dr. Fian also made no scruple in
	aiding and abetting murder, and would rid any person of an enemy
	by means of poison, who could pay him his fee for it. Euphemia
	Macalzean also was far from being pure. There is no doubt that she
	meditated the king’s death, and used such means to compass it as the
	superstition of the age directed. She was a devoted partisan of Bothwell,
	who was accused by many of the witches as having consulted
	them on the period of the king’s death. They were all found guilty,
	and sentenced to be hanged and burned. Barbara Napier, though
	found guilty upon other counts, was acquitted upon the charge of
	having been present at the great witch meeting in Berwick kirk. The
	king was highly displeased, and threatened to have the jury indicted
	for a wilful error upon an assize. They accordingly reconsidered their
	verdict, and threw themselves upon the king’s mercy for the fault they
	had committed. James was satisfied, and Barbara Napier was hanged
	along with Gellie Duncan, Agnes Sampson, Dr. Fian, and five-and-twenty
	others. Euphemia Macalzean met a harder fate. Her connexion
	with the bold and obnoxious Bothwell, and her share in poisoning
	one or two individuals who had stood in her way, were thought
	deserving of the severest punishment the law could inflict. Instead
	of the ordinary sentence, directing the criminal to be first strangled
	and then burned, the wretched woman was doomed “to be bound to
	a stake, and burned in ashes, <em>quick</em> to the death.” This cruel sentence
	was executed on the 25th of June, 1591.</p>

	<p>These trials had the most pernicious consequences all over Scotland.
	The lairds and ministers in their districts, armed with due
	power from the privy council, tried and condemned old women after
	the most summary fashion. Those who still clung to the ancient
	faith of Rome were the severest sufferers, as it was thought, after the
	disclosures of the fierce enmity borne by the devil towards a Protestant
	king and his Protestant wife, that all the Catholics were leagued
	with the powers of evil to work woe on the realm of Scotland. Upon
	a very moderate calculation, it is presumed that from the passing of
	the act of Queen Mary till the accession of James to the throne of
	England, a period of thirty-nine years, the average number of executions
	for witchcraft in Scotland was two hundred annually, or upwards
	of seventeen thousand altogether. For the first nine years the number
	was not one quarter so great; but towards the years 1590 to 1593, the
	number must have been more than four hundred. The case last cited
	was one of an extraordinary character. The general aspect of the trials
	will be better seen from that of Isabel Gowdie, which, as it would be
	both wearisome and disgusting to go through them all, is given as a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"></a>fair specimen, although it took place at a date somewhat later than
	the reign of James. This woman, wearied of her life by the persecutions
	of her neighbours, voluntarily gave herself up to justice, and
	made a confession, embodying the whole witch-creed of the period.
	She was undoubtedly a monomaniac of the most extraordinary
	kind. She said that she deserved to be stretched upon an iron
	rack, and that her crimes could never be atoned for, even if she were
	to be drawn asunder by wild horses. She named a long list of her
	associates, including nearly fifty women and a few warlocks. They
	dug up the graves of unchristened infants, whose limbs were serviceable
	in their enchantments. When they wanted to destroy the crops
	of an enemy, they yoked toads to his plough, and on the following
	night Satan himself ploughed the land with his team, and blasted it
	for the season. The witches had power to assume almost any shape;
	but they generally chose either that of a cat or a hare, oftenest the
	latter. Isabel said, that on one occasion, when she was in this disguise,
	she was sore pressed by a pack of hounds, and had a very narrow
	escape with her life. She reached her own door at last, feeling
	the hot breath of the pursuing dogs at her haunches. She managed,
	however, to hide herself behind a chest, and got time to pronounce
	the magic words that could alone restore her to her proper shape.
	They were:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Hare! hare!</p>
		<p>God send thee care!</p>
		<p class="i4">I am in a hare’s likeness now;</p>
		<p class="i4">But I shall be a woman e’en now!</p>
		<p>Hare! hare!</p>
		<p>God send thee care!”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">If witches, when in this shape, were bitten by the dogs, they always
	retained the marks in their human form; but she had never heard
	that any witch had been bitten to death. When the devil appointed
	any general meeting of the witches, the custom was that they should
	proceed through the air mounted on broomsticks, or on corn or bean-straws,
	pronouncing as they went:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Horse and pattock, horse and go,</p>
		<p>Horse and pellats, ho! ho! ho!”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">They generally left behind them a broom or a three-legged stool,
	which, when placed in their beds and duly charmed, assumed the
	human shape till their return. This was done that the neighbours
	might not know when they were absent.</p>

	<p>She added that the devil furnished his favourite witches with servant
	imps to attend upon them. These imps were called, “The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"></a>Roaring Lion,” “Thief of Hell,” “Wait-upon-Herself,” “Ranting
	Roarer,” “Care-for-Naught,” &amp;c., and were known by their liveries,
	which were generally yellow, sad-dun, sea-green, pea-green, or grass-green.
	Satan never called the witches by the names they had received
	at baptism; neither were they allowed, in his presence, so to designate
	each other. Such a breach of the infernal etiquette assuredly
	drew down his most severe displeasure. But as some designation was
	necessary, he re-baptised them in their own blood by the names of
	“Able-and-Stout,” “Over-the-dike-with-it,” “Raise-the-wind,”
	“Pickle-nearest-the-wind,” “Batter-them-down-Maggy,” “Blow-Kale,”
	and such like. The devil himself was not very particular what
	name they called him, so that it was not “Black John.” If any witch
	was unthinking enough to utter these words, he would rush out upon
	her and beat and buffet her unmercifully, or tear her flesh with a
	wool-card. Other names he did not care about; and once gave instructions
	to a noted warlock that whenever he wanted his aid, he
	was to strike the ground three times and exclaim, “Rise up, foul
	thief!”</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>Upon this confession many persons were executed. So strong
	was the popular feeling, that no one once accused of witchcraft was acquitted;
	at least acquittals did not average one in a hundred trials.
	Witch-finding, or witch-pricking, became a trade, and a set of mercenary
	vagabonds roamed about the country provided with long pins to
	run into the flesh of supposed criminals. It was no unusual thing
	then, nor is it now, that in aged persons there should be some spot
	on the body totally devoid of feeling. It was the object of the witch-pricker
	to discover this spot, and the unhappy wight who did not bleed
	when pricked upon it was doomed to the death. If not immediately
	cast into prison, her life was rendered miserable by the persecution
	of her neighbours. It is recorded of many poor women, that the
	annoyances they endured in this way were so excessive, that they preferred
	death. Sir George Mackenzie, the Lord Advocate, at the time
	when witch trials were so frequent, and himself a devout believer in
	the crime, relates, in his <cite>Criminal Law</cite>, first published in 1678, some
	remarkable instances of it. He says, “I went, when I was a justice-depute,
	to examine some women who had confessed judicially; and
	one of them, who was a silly creature, told me, under secrecy, that
	she had not confessed because she was guilty, but being a poor creature,
	who wrought for her meat, and being defamed for a witch, she
	knew she should starve, for no person thereafter would either give her
	meat or lodging, and that all men would beat her and set dogs at her,
	and that, therefore, she desired to be out of the world; whereupon
	she wept most bitterly, and upon her knees called God to witness to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"></a>what she said.” Sir George, though not wholly elevated above the
	prejudices of his age upon this subject, was clear-sighted enough to
	see the danger to society of the undue encouragement given to the
	witch prosecutions. He was
	convinced that three-fourths of
	them were unjust and unfounded.
	He says, in the work already
	quoted, that the persons
	who were in general accused of
	this crime were poor ignorant
	men and women who did not
	understand the nature of the
	accusation, and who mistook
	their own superstitious fears for
	witchcraft. One poor wretch,
	a weaver, confessed that he was
	a warlock, and, being asked
	why, he replied, because “he
	had seen the devil dancing,
	like a fly, about the candle!”
	A simple woman, who, because
	she was called a witch, believed that she was, asked the judge upon
	the bench whether a person might be a witch and not know it?
	Sir George adds, that all the supposed criminals were subjected to
	severe torture in prison from their gaolers, who thought they did God
	good service by vexing and tormenting them; “and I know,” says
	this humane and enlightened magistrate, “that this usage was the
	ground of all their confession; and albeit, the poor miscreants cannot
	prove this usage, the actors in it being the only witnesses; yet
	the judge should be jealous of it, as that which did at first elicit the
	confession, and for fear of which they dare not retract it.” Another
	author,<a href="#fn31" id="fnm31" title="Satan's Invisible World Discovered..." class="fnmarker">31</a> also a firm believer in witchcraft, gives a still more lamentable
	instance of a woman who preferred execution as a witch to live
	on under the imputation. This woman, who knew that three others
	were to be strangled and burned on an early day, sent for the minister
	of the parish, and confessed that she had sold her soul to Satan.
	“Whereupon being called before the judges, she was condemned to
	die with the rest. Being carried forth to the place of execution, she
	remained silent during the first, second, and third prayer, and then,
	perceiving that there remained no more but to rise and go to the stake,
	she lifted up her body, and, with a loud voice, cried out, ‘Now all
	you that see me this day, know that I am now to die as a witch, by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"></a>my own confession; and I free all men, especially the ministers and
	magistrates, of the guilt of my blood. I take it wholly upon myself.
	My blood be upon my own head. And, as I must make answer to
	the God of heaven presently, I declare I am as free of witchcraft as
	any child. But, being delated by a malicious woman, and put in
	prison under the name of a witch, disowned by my husband and
	friends, and seeing no ground of hope of ever coming out again, I made
	up that confession to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and
	choosing rather to die than to live.’” As a proof of the singular
	obstinacy and blindness of the believers in witches, it may be stated
	that the minister who relates this story only saw in the dying speech
	of the unhappy woman an additional proof that she was a witch.
	True, indeed is it, that “none are so blind as those who will not
	see.”</p>
	
	<p>It is time, however, to return to James VI., who is fairly entitled
	to share with Pope Innocent, Sprenger, Bodinus, and Matthew Hopkins
	the glory or the odium of being at the same time a chief enemy
	and chief encourager of witchcraft. Towards the close of the sixteenth
	century, many learned men, both on the continent and in the
	isles of Britain, had endeavoured to disabuse the public mind on
	this subject. The most celebrated were Wierus, in Germany; Pietro
	d’Apone, in Italy; and Reginald Scot, in England. Their works
	excited the attention of the zealous James, who, mindful of the
	involuntary compliment which his merits had extorted from the
	devil, was ambitious to deserve it by still continuing “his greatest
	enemie.” In the year 1597, he published in Edinburgh his famous
	treatise on Demonology. Its design may be gathered from the following
	passage in the introduction: “The fearful abounding,” says
	the king, “at this time and in this country of these detestable slaves
	of the devil, the witches or enchanters, hath moved me, beloved
	reader, to despatch in post this following treatise of mine, not in any
	wise, as I protest, to serve for a show of mine own learning and ingene
	[ingenuity], but only (moved of conscience) to press thereby, so far
	as I can, to resolve the doubting hearts of many, both that such assaults
	of Satan are most certainly practised, and that the instrument thereof
	merits most severely to be punished, against the damnable opinions of
	two, principally in our age; whereof the one called Scot, an Englishman,
	is not ashamed in public print to deny that there can be such
	thing as witchcraft, and so maintains the old error of the Sadducees in
	denying of spirits. The other, called Wierus, a German physician, sets
	out a public apology for all these crafts-folks, whereby procuring for
	them impunity, he plainly betrays himself to have been one of that
	profession.” In other parts of this treatise, which the author had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"></a>put into the form of a dialogue, to “make it more pleasant and facile,”
	he says: “Witches ought to be put to death, according to the law of
	God, the civil and imperial law, and the municipal law of all Christian
	nations: yea, to spare the
	life, and not strike whom
	God bids strike and so severely
	punish in so odious
	a treason against God, is
	not only unlawful, but
	doubtless as great a sin in
	the magistrate as was Saul’s
	sparing Agag.” He says
	also that the crime is so
	abominable, that it may be
	proved by evidence which
	would not be received
	against any other offenders,—young
	children, who
	knew not the nature of an
	oath, and persons of an infamous
	character, being
	sufficient witnesses against
	them; but lest the innocent
	should be accused of
	a crime so difficult to be
	acquitted of, he recommends
	that in all cases the
	ordeal should be resorted to. He says, “Two good helps may be used:
	the one is the finding of their mark, and the trying the insensibleness
	thereof; the other is their floating on the water,—for, as in a secret
	murther, if the dead carcass be at any time thereafter handled by the
	murtherer, it will gush out of blood, as if the blood were crying to
	Heaven for revenge of the murtherer (God having appointed that
	secret supernatural sign for trial of that secret unnatural crime), so
	that it appears that God hath appointed (for a supernatural sign of
	the monstrous impiety of witches) that the water shall refuse to receive
	them in her bosom that have shaken off them the sacred water
	of baptism, and wilfully refused the benefit thereof;—no, not so
	much as their eyes are able to shed tears (threaten and torture them
	as you please), while first they repent (God not permitting them to
	dissemble their obstinacy in so horrible a crime); albeit, the womenkind
	especially, be able otherwise to shed tears at every light occasion
	when they will, yea, although it were dissembling like the crocodiles.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"></a>When such doctrines as these were openly promulgated by the
	highest authority in the realm, and who, in promulgating them, flattered,
	but did not force the public opinion, it is not surprising that
	the sad delusion should have increased and multiplied until the race
	of wizards and witches replenished the earth. The reputation which
	he lost by being afraid of a naked sword, he more than regained by
	his courage in combating the devil. The Kirk shewed itself a most
	zealous coadjutor, especially during those halcyon days when it was
	not at issue with the king upon other matters of doctrine and prerogative.</p>

	<p>On his accession to the throne of England in 1603, James came
	amongst a people who had heard with admiration of his glorious deeds
	against the witches. He himself left no part of his ancient prejudices
	behind him; and his advent was the signal for the persecution to
	burst forth in England with a fury equal to that in Scotland. It had
	languished a little during the latter years of the reign of Elizabeth;
	but the very first parliament of King James brought forward the subject.
	James was flattered by their promptitude, and the act passed
	in 1604. On the second reading in the House of Lords, the bill
	passed into a committee, in which were twelve bishops. By it was
	enacted, “That if any person shall use, practise, or exercise any conjuration
	of any wicked or evil spirit, or shall consult, covenant with,
	or feed any such spirit, the first offence to be imprisonment for a
	year, and standing in the pillory once a quarter; the second offence
	to be death.”</p>

	<p>The minor punishment seems but rarely to have been inflicted.
	Every record that has been preserved mentions that the witches were
	hanged and burned, or burned, without the previous strangling,
	“alive and quick.” During the whole of James’s reign, amid the
	civil wars of his successor, the sway of the Long Parliament, the
	usurpation of Cromwell, and the reign of Charles II., there was no
	abatement of the persecution. If at any time it raged with less virulence,
	it was when Cromwell and the Independents were masters. Dr.
	Zachary Grey, the editor of an edition of “Hudibras,” informs us, in
	a note to that work, that he himself perused a list of three thousand
	witches who were executed in the time of the Long Parliament alone.
	During the first eighty years of the seventeenth century, the number
	executed has been estimated at five hundred annually, making the
	frightful total of forty thousand. Some of these cases deserve to be
	cited. The great majority resemble closely those already mentioned;
	but two or three of them let in a new light upon the popular superstition.</p>

	<p>Every one has heard of the “Lancashire witches,” a phrase now
	<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"></a>used to compliment the ladies of that county for their bewitching
	beauty; but it is not every one who has heard the story in which it
	originated. A villanous boy, named Robinson, was the chief actor
	in the tragedy. He confessed many years afterwards that he had
	been suborned by his father and other persons to give false evidence
	against the unhappy witches whom he brought to the stake. The
	time of this famous trial was about the year 1634. This boy Robinson,
	whose father was a wood-cutter, residing on the borders of Pendle
	Forest, in Lancashire, spread abroad many rumours against one Mother
	Dickenson, whom he accused of being a witch. These rumours coming
	to the ears of the local magistracy, the boy was sent for and
	strictly examined. He told the following extraordinary story without
	hesitation or prevarication, and apparently in so open and honest a
	manner, that no one who heard him doubted the truth of it. He
	said, that as he was roaming about in one of the glades of the forest,
	amusing himself by gathering blackberries, he saw two greyhounds
	before him, which he thought at the time belonged to some gentleman
	of the neighbourhood. Being fond of sport, he proposed to have
	a course; and a hare being started, he incited the hounds to run.
	Neither of them would stir. Angry at the beasts, he seized hold of a
	switch, with which he was about to punish them, when one of them
	suddenly started up in the form of a woman, and the other of a little
	boy. He at once recognised the woman to be the witch Mother
	Dickenson. She offered him some money to induce him to sell his
	soul to the devil; but he refused. Upon this she took a bridle out of
	her pocket, and shaking it over the head of the other little boy, he
	was instantly turned into a horse. Mother Dickenson then seized
	him in her arms, sprang upon the horse, and placing him before her,
	rode with the swiftness of the wind over forests, fields, bogs, and
	rivers, until they came to a large barn. The witch alighted at the
	door, and, taking him by the hand, led him inside. There he saw
	seven old women pulling at seven halters which hung from the roof.
	As they pulled, large pieces of meat, lumps of butter, loaves of bread,
	basins of milk, hot puddings, black puddings, and other rural dainties,
	fell from the halters on to the floor. While engaged in this charm,
	they made such ugly faces, and looked so fiendish, that he was quite
	frightened. After they had pulled in this manner enough for an
	ample feast, they set-to, and shewed, whatever might be said of the
	way in which their supper was procured, that their epicurism was a
	little more refined than that of the Scottish witches, who, according
	to Gellie Duncan’s confession, feasted upon dead men’s flesh in the old
	kirk of Berwick. The boy added, that as soon as supper was ready,
	many other witches came to partake of it, several of whom he named.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"></a>In consequence of this story, many persons were arrested, and
	the boy Robinson was led about from church to church, in order
	that he might point out to the officers by whom he was accompanied
	the hags he had seen in the barn. Altogether, about twenty persons
	were thrown into prison; eight of them were condemned to die, including
	Mother Dickenson, upon this evidence alone, and executed
	accordingly. Among the wretches who concocted this notable story,
	not one was ever brought to justice for his perjury; and Robinson,
	the father, gained considerable sums by threatening persons who were
	rich enough to buy off exposure.</p>

	<p>Among the ill-weeds which flourished amid the long dissensions
	of the civil war, Matthew Hopkins, the witch-finder, stands eminent
	in his sphere. This vulgar fellow resided, in the year 1644, at the
	town of Manningtree, in Essex, and made himself very conspicuous
	in discovering the devil’s marks upon several unhappy witches. The
	credit he gained by his skill in this instance seems to have inspired
	him to renewed exertions. In the course of a very short time, whenever
	a witch was spoken of in Essex, Matthew Hopkins was sure to
	be present, aiding the judges with his knowledge of “such cattle,”
	as he called them. As his reputation increased, he assumed the title
	of “Witch-finder General,” and travelled through the counties of
	Norfolk, Essex, Huntingdon, and Sussex, for the sole purpose of finding
	out witches. In one year he brought sixty poor creatures to the
	stake. The test he commonly adopted was that of swimming, so
	highly recommended by King James in his <cite>Demonologie</cite>. The hands
	and feet of the suspected persons were tied together crosswise, the
	thumb of the right hand to the toe of the left foot, and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</em>.
	They were then wrapped up in a large sheet or blanket, and laid
	upon their backs in a pond or river. If they sank, their friends and
	relatives had the poor consolation of knowing they were innocent;
	but there was an end of them: if they floated, which, when laid
	carefully on the water, was generally the case, there was also an end
	of them; for they were deemed guilty of witchcraft, and burned
	accordingly.</p>

	<p>Another test was to make them repeat the Lord’s prayer and
	creed. It was affirmed that no witch could do so correctly. If she
	missed a word, or even pronounced one incoherently, which in her
	trepidation it was most probable she would, she was accounted
	guilty. It was thought that witches could not weep more than three
	tears, and those only from the left eye. Thus the conscious innocence
	of many persons, which gave them fortitude to bear unmerited
	torture without flinching, was construed by their unmerciful tormentors
	into proofs of guilt. In some districts the test resorted to was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"></a>to weigh the culprit against the church Bible. If the suspected witch
	proved heavier than the Bible, she was set at liberty. This mode
	was far too humane for the witch-finders by profession. Hopkins
	always maintained that the most legitimate modes were pricking and
	swimming.</p>

	<p>Hopkins used to travel through his counties like a man of consideration,
	attended by his two assistants, always putting up at the
	chief inn of the place, and always at the cost of the authorities. His
	charges were twenty shillings a town, his expenses of living while
	there, and his carriage thither and back. This he claimed whether
	he found witches or not. If he found any, he claimed twenty shillings
	a head in addition when they were brought to execution. For
	about three years he carried on this infamous trade, success making
	him so insolent and rapacious that high and low became his enemies.
	The Rev. Mr. Gaul, a clergyman of Houghton, in Huntingdonshire,
	wrote a pamphlet impugning his pretensions, and accusing him of
	being a common nuisance. Hopkins replied in an angry letter to the
	functionaries of Houghton, stating his intention to visit their town;
	but desiring to know whether it afforded many such sticklers for
	witchcraft as Mr. Gaul, and whether they were willing to receive and
	entertain him with the customary hospitality, if he so far honoured
	them. He added, by way of threat, that in case he did not receive a
	satisfactory reply, “he would waive their shire altogether, and betake
	himself to such places where he might do and punish, not only without
	control, but with thanks and recompense.” The authorities of
	Houghton were not much alarmed at this awful threat of letting
	them alone. They very wisely took no notice either of him or his
	letter.</p>

	<p>Mr. Gaul describes in his pamphlet one of the modes employed by
	Hopkins, which was sure to swell his revenues very considerably. It
	was a proof even more atrocious than the swimming. He says, that
	the “Witch-finder General” used to take the suspected witch and
	place her in the middle of a room, upon a stool or table, cross-legged,
	or in some other uneasy posture. If she refused to sit in this manner,
	she was bound with strong cords. Hopkins then placed persons
	to watch her for four-and-twenty hours, during which time she was
	to be kept without meat or drink. It was supposed that one of her
	imps would come during that interval and suck her blood. As the
	imp might come in the shape of a wasp, a moth, a fly, or other insect,
	a hole was made in the door or window to let it enter. The
	watchers were ordered to keep a sharp look out, and endeavour to
	kill any insect that appeared in the room. If any fly escaped, and
	they could not kill it, the woman was guilty; the fly was her imp,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"></a>and she was sentenced to be burned, and twenty shillings went into
	the pockets of Master Hopkins. In this manner he made one old
	woman confess, because four flies had appeared in the room, that she
	was attended by four imps, named “Ilemazar,” “Pye-wackett,”
	“Peck-in-the-crown,” and “Grizel-Greedigut.”</p>

	</div>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"></a>It is consoling to think that this impostor perished in his own
	snare. Mr. Gaul’s exposure and his own rapacity weakened his influence
	among the magistrates; and the populace, who began to find
	that not even the most virtuous and innocent were secure from his
	persecution, looked upon him with undisguised aversion. He was
	beset by a mob at a village in Suffolk, and accused of being himself
	a wizard. An old reproach was brought against him, that he had, by
	means of sorcery, cheated the devil out of a certain memorandum-book,
	in which he, Satan, had entered the names of all the witches
	in England. “Thus,” said the populace, “you find out witches, not
	by God’s aid, but by the devil’s.” In vain he denied his guilt. The
	populace longed to put him to his own test. He was speedily
	stripped, and his thumbs and toes tied together. He was then placed
	in a blanket, and cast into a pond. Some say that he floated, and
	that he was taken out, tried, and executed upon no other proof of
	his guilt. Others assert that he was drowned. This much is positive,
	that there was an end of him. As no judicial entry of his trial and
	execution is to be found in any register, it appears most probable that
	he expired by the hands of the mob. Butler has immortalised this
	scamp in the following lines of his <cite>Hudibras</cite>:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Hath not this present Parliament</p>
		<p>A lieger to the devil sent,</p>
		<p>Fully empower’d to treat about</p>
		<p>Finding revolted witches out?</p>
		<p>And has he not within a year</p>
		<p>Hang’d threescore of them in one shire?</p>
		<p>Some only for not being drown’d,</p>
		<p>And some for sitting above ground</p>
		<p>Whole days and nights upon their breeches,</p>
		<p>And feeling pain, were hang’d for witches;</p>
		<p>And some for putting knavish tricks</p>
		<p>Upon green geese or turkey chicks;</p>
		<p>Or pigs that suddenly deceased</p>
		<p>Of griefs unnatural, as he guessed;</p>
		<p>Who proved himself at length a witch,</p>
		<p>And made a rod for his own breech.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>In Scotland also witch-finding became a trade. They were known
	under the designation of “common prickers,” and, like Hopkins,
	received a fee for each witch they discovered. At the trial of Janet
	Peaston, in 1646, the magistrates of Dalkeith “caused John Kincaid
	of Tranent, the common pricker, to exercise his craft upon her. He
	found two marks of the devil’s making; for she could not feel the
	pin when it was put into either of the said marks, nor did the marks
	<a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"></a>bleed when the pin was taken out again. When she was asked where
	she thought the pins were put in her, she pointed to a part of her
	body distant from the real place. They were pins of three inches in
	length.”<a href="#fn33" id="fnm33" title="Pitcairn's..." class="fnmarker">33</a></p>
	
	<p>These common prickers became at last so numerous that they were
	considered nuisances. The judges refused to take their evidence; and
	in 1678 the privy council of Scotland condescended to hear the complaint
	of an honest woman who had been indecently exposed by one
	of them, and expressed their opinion that common prickers were common
	cheats.</p>

	<p>But such an opinion was not formed in high places before hundreds
	of innocent persons had fallen victims. The parliaments had
	encouraged the delusion both in England and Scotland; and by
	arming these fellows with a sort of authority, had in a manner forced
	the magistrates and ministers to receive their evidence. The fate of
	one poor old gentleman, who fell a victim to the arts of Hopkins in
	1646, deserves to be recorded. Mr. Louis, a venerable clergyman,
	upwards of seventy years of age, and who had been rector of Framlingham,
	in Suffolk, for fifty years, excited suspicion that he was a
	wizard. Being a violent royalist, he was likely to meet with no sympathy
	at that time; and even his own parishioners, whom he had
	served so long and so faithfully, turned their backs upon him as soon
	as he was accused. Placed under the hands of Hopkins, who knew
	so well how to bring the refractory to confession, the old man, the
	light of whose intellect had become somewhat dimmed from age,
	confessed that he was a wizard. He said he had two imps that continually
	excited him to do evil; and that one day, when he was
	walking on the sea-coast, one of them prompted him to express a wish
	that a ship, whose sails were just visible in the distance, might sink.
	He consented, and saw the vessel sink before his eyes. He was, upon
	this confession, tried and condemned. On his trial, the flame of
	reason burned up as brightly as ever. He denied all that had been
	alleged against him, and cross-examined Hopkins with great tact and
	severity. After his condemnation, he begged that the funeral service
	of the Church might be read for him. The request was refused, and
	he repeated it for himself from memory as he was led to the scaffold.</p>

	<p>A poor woman in Scotland was executed upon evidence even less
	strong than this. John Bain, a common pricker, swore that, as he
	passed her door, he heard her talking to the devil. She said, in defence,
	that it was a foolish practice she had of talking to herself, and
	several of her neighbours corroborated her statement; but the evidence
	of the pricker was received. He swore that none ever talked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"></a>to themselves who were not witches. The devil’s mark being found
	upon her, the additional testimony of her guilt was deemed conclusive,
	and she was “convict and brynt.”</p>

	<p>From the year 1652 to 1682, these trials diminished annually in
	number, and acquittals were by no means so rare as they had been.
	To doubt in witchcraft was no longer dangerous. Before country
	justices, condemnations on the most absurd evidence still continued;
	but when the judges of the land had to charge the jury, they took
	a more humane and philosophical view. By degrees, the educated
	classes (comprised in those days within very narrow limits) openly expressed
	their unbelief of modern witchcraft, although they were not
	bold enough to deny its existence altogether. Between them and
	the believers in the old doctrine fierce arguments ensued, and the
	sceptics were designated Sadducees. To convince them, the learned
	and Reverend Joseph Glanvil wrote his well-known work, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sadducismus
	Triumphatus</cite>, and <cite>The Collection of Relations</cite>; the first part intended
	as a philosophical inquiry into witchcraft, and the power of
	the devil “to assume a mortal shape:” the latter containing what
	he considered a multitude of well-authenticated modern instances.</p>

	</div>

	<p>But though progress
	was made, it
	was slow. In 1664,
	the venerable Sir
	Matthew Hale condemned
	two women,
	named Amy
	Duny and Rose Cullender,
	to the stake
	at St. Edmondsbury,
	upon evidence
	the most ridiculous.
	These two old women,
	whose ugliness
	gave their neighbours
	the first idea
	that they were
	witches, went to a
	shop to purchase
	herrings, and were
	refused. Indignant
	at the prejudice against them, they were not sparing of their abuse.
	Shortly afterward, the daughter of the herring-dealer fell sick, and a
	cry was raised that she was bewitched by the old women who had been
	<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"></a>refused the herrings. This girl was subject to epileptic fits. To discover
	the guilt of Amy Duny and Rose Cullender, the girl’s eyes
	were blinded closely with a shawl, and the witches were commanded
	to touch her. They did so, and she was immediately seized with a
	fit. Upon this evidence they were sent to prison. The girl was afterwards
	touched by an indifferent person, and the force of her imagination
	was so great, that, thinking it was again the witches, she
	fell down in a violent fit as before. This, however, was not received
	in favour of the accused.</p>

	<p>The following extract, from the published reports of the trial,
	will shew the sort of evidence which was received:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Samuel Pacey, of Leystoff (a good, sober man), being sworn,
		said that, on Thursday the 10th of October last, his younger daughter,
		Deborah, about nine years old, was suddenly taken so lame that
		she could not stand on her legs, and so continued till the 17th of
		the same month, when the child desired to be carried to a bank on
		the east side of the house, looking towards the sea; and, while she
		was sitting there, Amy Duny came to this examinant’s house to buy
		some herrings, but was denied. Then she came twice more, but,
		being as often denied, she went away discontented and grumbling.
		At this instant of time, the child was taken with terrible fits, complaining
		of a pain in her stomach, as if she was pricked with pins,
		shrieking out with a voice like a whelp, and thus continued till the
		30th of the same month. This examinant further saith, that Amy
		Duny, having long had the reputation of a witch, and his child having,
		in the intervals of her fits, constantly cried out on her as the
		cause of her disorder, saying, that the said Amy did appear to her
		and fright her; he himself did suspect the said Amy to be a witch,
		and charged her with being the cause of his child’s illness, and set
		her in the stocks. Two days after, his daughter Elizabeth was taken
		with such strange fits, that they could not force open her mouth without
		a tap; and the younger child being in the same condition, they
		used to her the same remedy. Both children grievously complained
		that Amy Duny and another woman, whose habit and looks they
		described, did appear to them and torment them, and would cry out,
		‘There stands Amy Duny! There stands Rose Cullender!’ the other
		person who afflicted them. Their fits were not alike. Sometimes
		they were lame on the right side; sometimes on the left; and sometimes
		so sore, that they could not bear to be touched. Sometimes
		they were perfectly well in other respects, but they could not <em>hear</em>;
		at other times they could not <em>see</em>. Sometimes they lost their speech
		for one, two, and once for eight days together. At times they had
		swooning fits, and, when they could speak, were taken with a fit of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"></a>coughing, and vomited phlegm and crooked pins; and once a great
		twopenny nail, with above forty pins; which nail he, the examinant,
		saw vomited up, with many of the pins. The nail and pins were
		produced in the court. Thus the children continued for two months,
		during which time the examinant often made them read in the New
		Testament, and observed, when they came to the words <em>Lord Jesus</em>,
		or <em>Christ</em>, they could not pronounce them, but fell into a fit. When
		they came to the word <em>Satan</em>, or <em>devil</em>, they would point, and say,
		‘This bites, but makes me speak right well.’ Finding his children
		thus tormented without hopes of recovery, he sent them to his sister,
		Margaret Arnold, at Yarmouth, being willing to try whether change
		of air would help them.</p>

		<p>“Margaret Arnold was the next witness. Being sworn, she said,
		that about the 30th of November, Elizabeth and Deborah Pacey
		came to her house, with her brother, who told her what had happened,
		and that he thought his children bewitched. She, this examinant,
		did not much regard it, supposing the children had played
		tricks, and put the pins into their mouths themselves. She therefore
		took all the pins from their clothes, sewing them with thread
		instead of pinning them. But, notwithstanding, they raised, at
		times, at least thirty pins in her presence, and had terrible fits; in
		which fits they would cry out upon Amy Duny and Rose Cullender,
		saying, that they saw them and heard them threatening, as before;
		that they saw things like mice running about the house; and one
		of them catched one, and threw it into the fire, which made a noise
		like a rat. Another time the younger child, being out of doors, a
		thing like a bee would have forced itself into her mouth, at which
		the child ran screaming into the house, and before this examinant
		could come at her, fell into a fit, and vomited a twopenny nail, with
		a broad head. After that, this examinant asked the child how she
		came by this nail, when she answered, ‘The bee brought the nail,
		and forced it into my mouth.’ At other times, the eldest child told
		this examinant that she saw flies bring her crooked pins. She would
		then fall into a fit, and vomit such pins. One time the said child
		said she saw a mouse, and crept under the table to look for it; and
		afterwards, the child seemed to put something into her apron, saying,
		‘She had caught it.’ She then ran to the fire, and threw it in,
		on which there did appear to this examinant something like a flash
		of gunpowder, although she does own she saw nothing in the child’s
		hand. Once the child, being speechless, but otherwise very sensible,
		ran up and down the house, crying, ‘Hush! hush!’ as if she had
		seen poultry; but this examinant saw nothing. At last the child
		catched at something, and threw it into the fire. Afterwards, when
		<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"></a>the child could speak, this examinant asked her what she saw at
		the time? She answered that she saw a duck. Another time the
		youngest child said, after a fit, that Amy Duny had been with her,
		and tempted her to drown herself, or cut her throat, or otherwise
		destroy herself. Another time they both cried out upon Amy Duny
		and Rose Cullender, saying, ‘Why don’t you come yourselves? Why
		do you send your imps to torment us?’”</p>

		<p class="caption">SIR THOMAS BROWN.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>The celebrated Sir Thomas Brown, the author of <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>,
	was also examined as a
	witness upon the trial.
	Being desired to give his
	opinion of the three persons
	in court, he said he
	was clearly of opinion that
	they were bewitched. He
	said there had lately been
	a discovery of witches in
	Denmark, who used the
	same way of tormenting
	persons, by conveying
	crooked pins, needles, and
	nails into their bodies.
	That he thought, in such
	cases, the devil acted upon
	human bodies by natural
	means, namely, by exciting
	and stirring up the
	superabundant humours; he did afflict them in a more surprising
	manner by the same diseases their bodies were usually subject to;
	that these fits might be natural, only raised to a great degree by the
	subtlety of the devil, co-operating with the malice of these witches.</p>
	
	<p>The evidence being concluded, Sir Matthew Hale addressed the
	jury. He said, he would waive repeating the evidence, to prevent
	any mistake, and told the jury there were two things they had to
	inquire into. First, Whether or not these children were bewitched;
	secondly, Whether these women did bewitch them. He said, he did
	not in the least doubt there were witches; first, Because the Scriptures
	affirmed it; secondly, Because the wisdom of all nations, particularly
	our own, had provided laws against witchcraft, which implied
	their belief of such a crime. He desired them strictly to observe
	the evidence, and begged of God to direct their hearts in the weighty
	concern they had in hand, since, to condemn the innocent and let
	the guilty go free are both an abomination to the Lord.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"></a>The jury then retired, and in about half an hour returned a
	verdict of guilty upon all the indictments, being thirteen in number.
	The next morning the children came with their father to the lodgings
	of Sir Matthew Hale, very well, and quite restored to their usual
	health. Mr. Pacey, being asked at what time their health began to
	improve, replied, that they were quite well in half an hour after the
	conviction of the prisoners.</p>

	<p>Many attempts were made to induce the unfortunate women to
	confess their guilt; but in vain, and they were both hanged.</p>

	<p>Eleven trials were instituted before Chief Justice Holt for witchcraft,
	between the years 1694 and 1701. The evidence was of the
	usual character; but Holt appealed so successfully in each case to the
	common sense of the jury, that they were every one acquitted. A
	general feeling seemed to pervade the country that blood enough had
	been shed upon these absurd charges. Now and then, the flame of
	persecution burnt up in a remote district; but these instances were
	no longer looked upon as mere matters of course. They appear, on
	the contrary, to have excited much attention; a sure proof, if no other
	were to be obtained, that they were becoming unfrequent.</p>

	<p>A case of witchcraft was tried in 1711, before Lord Chief Justice
	Powell; in which, however, the jury persisted in a verdict of guilty,
	though the evidence was of the usual absurd and contradictory character,
	and the enlightened judge did all in his power to bring them
	to a right conclusion. The accused person was one Jane Wenham,
	better known as the Witch of Walkerne; and the persons who were
	alleged to have suffered from her witchcraft were two young women,
	named Thorne and Street. A witness, named Mr. Arthur Chauncy,
	deposed, that he had seen Ann Thorne in several of her fits, and that
	she always recovered upon prayers being said, or if Jane Wenham
	came to her. He related, that he had pricked the prisoner several
	times in the arms, but could never fetch any blood from her; that
	he had seen her vomit pins, when there were none in her clothes or
	within her reach; and that he had preserved several of them, which
	he was ready to produce. The judge, however, told him that was
	needless, <em>as he supposed they were crooked pins</em>.</p>

	<p>Mr. Francis Bragge, another witness, deposed, that strange
	“cakes” of bewitched feathers having been taken from Ann Thorne’s
	pillow, he was anxious to see them. He went into a room where
	some of these feathers were, and took two of the cakes, and compared
	them together. They were both of a circular figure, something larger
	than a crown piece; and he observed that the small feathers were
	placed in a nice and curious order, at equal distances from each other,
	making so many radii of the circle, in the centre of which the quill-ends
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"></a>of the feathers met. He counted the number of these feathers,
	and found them to be exactly thirty-two in each cake. He afterwards
	endeavoured to pull off two or three of them, and observed that they
	were all fastened together by a sort of viscous matter, which would
	stretch seven or eight times in a thread before it broke. Having
	taken off several of these feathers, he removed the viscous matter
	with his fingers, and found under it, in the centre, some short hairs,
	black and grey, matted together, which he verily believed to be cat’s
	hair. He also said, that Jane Wenham confessed to him that she
	had bewitched the pillow, and had practised witchcraft for sixteen
	years.</p>

	<p>The judge interrupted the witness at this stage, and said, he
	should very much like to see an enchanted feather, and seemed to
	wonder when he was told that none of these strange cakes had been
	preserved. His lordship asked the witness why he did not keep one
	or two of them, and was informed that they had all been burnt, in
	order to relieve the bewitched person of the pains she suffered, which
	could not be so well effected by any other means.</p>

	<p>A man, named Thomas Ireland, deposed, that hearing several
	times a great noise of cats crying and screaming about his house, he
	went out and frightened them away, and they all ran towards the
	cottage of Jane Wenham. One of them he swore positively had a
	face very like Jane Wenham’s. Another man, named Burville, gave
	similar evidence, and swore that he had often seen a cat with Jane
	Wenham’s face. Upon one occasion he was in Ann Thorne’s chamber,
	when several cats came in, and among them the cat above stated.
	This witness would have favoured the court with a much longer statement,
	but was stopped by the judge, who said he had heard quite
	enough.</p>

	<p>The prisoner, in her defence, said nothing, but that “she was a
	clear woman.” The learned judge then summed up, leaving it to
	the jury to determine whether such evidence as they had heard was
	sufficient to take away the prisoner’s life upon the indictment. After
	a long deliberation they brought in their verdict, that she was guilty
	upon the evidence. The judge then asked them whether they found
	her guilty upon the indictment of conversing with the devil in the
	shape of a cat? The sapient foreman very gravely answered, “We
	find her guilty of <em>that</em>.” The learned judge then very reluctantly
	proceeded to pass sentence of death; but, by his persevering exertions,
	a pardon was at last obtained, and the wretched old woman
	was set at liberty.</p>

	<p>In the year 1716, a woman and her daughter—the latter only
	nine years of age—were hanged at Huntingdon for selling their souls
	<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"></a>to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off their stockings and
	making a lather of soap. This appears to have been the last judicial
	execution in England. From that time to the year 1736, the populace
	raised at intervals the old cry, and more than once endangered
	the lives of poor women by dragging them through ponds on suspicion;
	but the philosophy of those who, from their position, sooner or
	later give the tone to the opinions and morals of the poor, was silently
	working a cure for the evil. The fear of witches ceased to be epidemic,
	and became individual, lingering only in minds fettered by inveterate
	prejudice or brutalising superstition. In the year 1736, the
	penal statute of James I. was finally blotted from the statute-book,
	and suffered no longer to disgrace the advancing intelligence of the
	country. Pretenders to witchcraft, fortune-tellers, conjurors, and all
	their train, were liable only to the common punishment of rogues
	and impostors—imprisonment and the pillory.</p>

	<p>In Scotland, the delusion also assumed the same phases, and was
	gradually extinguished in the light of civilisation. As in England,
	the progress of improvement was slow. Up to the year 1665, little
	or no diminution of the mania was perceptible. In 1643, the General
	Assembly recommended that the privy council should institute a
	standing commission, composed of any “understanding gentlemen or
	magistrates,” to try the witches, who were stated to have increased
	enormously of late years. In 1649, an act was passed, confirmatory
	of the original statute of Queen Mary, explaining some points of the
	latter which were doubtful, and enacting severe penalties, not only
	against witches themselves, but against all who covenanted with
	them, or sought by their means to pry into the secrets of futurity, or
	cause any evil to the life, lands, or limbs of their neighbours. For
	the next ten years, the popular madness upon this subject was perhaps
	more furious than ever; upwards of four thousand persons suffered
	for the crime during that interval. This was the consequence of the
	act of parliament and the unparalleled severity of the magistrates;
	the latter frequently complained that for two witches they burned
	one day, there were ten to burn the next: they never thought that
	they themselves were the cause of the increase. In a single circuit,
	held at Glasgow, Ayr, and Stirling, in 1659, seventeen unhappy creatures
	were burned by judicial sentence for trafficking with Satan. In
	one day (November 7, 1661), the privy council issued no less than
	fourteen commissions for trials in the provinces. Next year, the violence
	of the persecution seems to have abated. From 1662 to 1668,
	although “the understanding gentlemen and magistrates” already
	mentioned, continued to try and condemn, the High Court of Justiciary
	had but one offender of this class to deal with, and she was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"></a>acquitted. James Welsh, a common pricker, was ordered to be publicly
	whipped through the streets of Edinburgh for falsely accusing a
	woman of witchcraft; a fact which alone proves that the superior
	court sifted the evidence in these cases with much more care and
	severity than it had done a few years previously. The enlightened
	Sir George Mackenzie, styled by Dryden “the noble wit of Scotland,”
	laboured hard to introduce this rule into court, that the confessions
	of the witches should be held of little worth, and that the evidence
	of the prickers and other interested persons should be received with
	distrust and jealousy. This was reversing the old practice, and saved
	many innocent lives. Though a firm believer both in ancient and
	modern witchcraft, he could not shut his eyes to the atrocities daily
	committed under the name of justice. In his work on the Criminal
	Law of Scotland, published in 1678, he says, “From the horridness
	of this crime, I do conclude that, of all others, it requires the clearest
	relevancy and most convincing probature; and I condemn, next to
	the witches themselves, those cruel and too forward judges who
	burn persons by thousands as guilty of this crime.” In the same
	year, Sir John Clerk plumply refused to serve as a commissioner on
	trials for witchcraft, alleging, by way of excuse, “that he was not
	himself good conjuror enough to be duly qualified.” The views entertained
	by Sir George Mackenzie were so favourably received by the
	Lords of Session, that he was deputed, in 1680, to report to them on
	the cases of a number of poor women who were then in prison awaiting
	their trial. Sir George stated that there was no evidence against
	them whatever but their own confessions, which were absurd and contradictory,
	and drawn from them by severe torture. They were immediately
	discharged.</p>

	<p>For the next sixteen years the Lords of Session were unoccupied
	with trials for witchcraft. Not one is entered upon the record. But
	in 1697 a case occurred which equalled in absurdity any of those that
	signalised the dark reign of King James. A girl named Christiana
	Shaw, eleven years of age, the daughter of John Shaw of Bargarran,
	was subject to fits; and being of a spiteful temper, she accused her
	maid-servant, with whom she had frequent quarrels, of bewitching
	her. Her story unfortunately was believed. Encouraged to tell all
	the persecutions of the devil which the maid had sent to torment her,
	she in the end concocted a romance that involved twenty-one persons.
	There was no other evidence against them but the fancies of this lying
	child, and the confessions which pain had extorted from them; but
	upon this no less than five women were condemned before Lord Blantyre
	and the rest of the commissioners, appointed specially by the
	privy council to try this case. They were burned on the Green at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"></a>Paisley. The warlock of the party, one John Reed, who was also
	condemned, hanged himself in prison. It was the general belief in
	Paisley that the devil had strangled him lest he should have revealed
	in his last moments too many of the unholy secrets of witchcraft.
	This trial excited considerable disgust in Scotland. The Rev. Mr.
	Bell, a contemporary writer, observed that, in this business, “persons
	of more goodness and esteem than most of their calumniators were
	defamed for witches.” He adds, that the persons chiefly to blame
	were “certain ministers of too much forwardness and absurd credulity,
	and some topping professors in and about Glasgow.”<a href="#fn34" id="fnm34" title="Preface to..." class="fnmarker">34</a></p>
	
	<p>After this trial, there again occurs a lapse of seven years, when
	the subject was painfully forced upon public attention by the brutal
	cruelty of the mob at Pittenween. Two women were accused of having
	bewitched a strolling beggar who was subject to fits, or who pretended
	to be so, for the purpose of exciting commiseration. They
	were cast into prison, and tortured until they confessed. One of
	them, named Janet Cornfoot, contrived to escape, but was brought
	back to Pittenween next day by a party of soldiers. On her approach
	to the town she was unfortunately met by a furious mob, composed
	principally of fishermen and their wives, who seized upon her with
	the intention of swimming her. They forced her away to the sea-shore,
	and tying a rope around her body, secured the end of it to the
	mast of a fishing-boat lying alongside. In this manner they ducked
	her several times. When she was half dead, a sailor in the boat cut
	away the rope, and the mob dragged her through the sea to the
	beach. Here, as she lay quite insensible, a brawny ruffian took down
	the door of his hut, close by, and placed it on her back. The mob
	gathered large stones from the beach and piled them upon her till the
	wretched woman was pressed to death. No magistrate made the
	slightest attempt to interfere; and the soldiers looked on, delighted
	spectators. A great outcry was raised against this culpable remissness,
	but no judicial inquiry was set on foot. This happened in 1704.</p>

	<p>The next case we hear of is that of Elspeth Rule, found guilty of
	witchcraft before Lord Anstruther, at the Dumfries circuit, in 1708.
	She was sentenced to be marked in the cheek with a red-hot iron,
	and banished the realm of Scotland for life.</p>

	<p>Again there is a long interval. In 1718, the remote county of
	Caithness, where the delusion remained in all its pristine vigour for
	years after it had ceased elsewhere, was startled from its propriety by
	the cry of witchcraft. A silly fellow, named William Montgomery,
	a carpenter, had a mortal antipathy to cats; and somehow or other
	these animals generally chose his back-yard as the scene of their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"></a>catterwaulings. He puzzled his brains for a long time to know why he,
	above all his neighbours, should be so pestered. At last he came to
	the sage conclusion that his tormentors were no cats, but witches.
	In this opinion he was supported by his maid-servant, who swore a
	round oath that she had often heard the aforesaid cats talking together
	in human voices. The next time the unlucky tabbies assembled
	in his back-yard, the valiant carpenter was on the alert. Arming
	himself with an axe, a dirk, and a broadsword, he rushed out among
	them. One of them he wounded in the back, a second in the hip,
	and the leg of a third he maimed with his axe; but he could not capture
	any of them. A few days afterwards, two old women of the
	parish died; and it was said, that when their bodies were laid out,
	there appeared upon the back of one the mark as of a recent wound,
	and a similar scar upon the hip of the other. The carpenter and his
	maid were convinced that they were the very cats, and the whole
	county repeated the same story. Every one was upon the look-out
	for proofs corroborative; a very remarkable one was soon discovered.
	Nanny Gilbert, a wretched old creature of upwards of seventy years
	of age, was found in bed with her leg broken. As she was ugly
	enough for a witch, it was asserted that she also was one of the cats
	that had fared so ill at the hands of the carpenter. The latter, when
	informed of the popular suspicion, asserted that he distinctly remembered
	to have struck one of the cats a blow with the back of his
	broadsword, which ought to have broken her leg. Nanny was immediately
	dragged from her bed and thrown into prison. Before she
	was put to the torture, she explained in a very natural and intelligible
	manner how she had broken her limb; but this account did not give
	satisfaction. The professional persuasions of the torturer made her
	tell a different tale, and she confessed that she was indeed a witch,
	and had been wounded by Montgomery on the night stated; that the
	two old women recently deceased were witches also, besides about a
	score of others whom she named. The poor creature suffered so much
	by the removal from her own home, and the tortures inflicted upon
	her, that she died the next day in prison. Happily for the persons
	she had named in her confession, Dundas of Arniston, at that time
	the king’s advocate-general, wrote to the sheriff-depute, one Captain
	Ross of Littledean, cautioning him not to proceed to trial, the “thing
	being of too great difficulty, and beyond the jurisdiction of an inferior
	court.” Dundas himself examined the precognition with great care,
	and was so convinced of the utter folly of the whole case, that he
	quashed all further proceedings.</p>

	<p>We find this same sheriff-depute of Caithness very active four years
	afterwards in another trial for witchcraft. In spite of the warning he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"></a>had received that all such cases were to be tried in future by the
	superior courts, he condemned to death an old woman at Dornoch,
	upon the charge of bewitching the cows and pigs of her neighbours.
	This poor creature was insane, and actually laughed and clapped her
	hands at sight of “the bonnie fire” that was to consume her. She
	had a daughter who was lame both of her hands and feet, and one of
	the charges brought against her was, that she had used this daughter
	as a pony in her excursions to join the devil’s sabbath, and that the
	devil himself had shod her, and produced lameness.</p>

	<p>This was the last execution that took place in Scotland for witchcraft.
	The penal statutes were repealed in 1736; and, as in England,
	whipping, the pillory, or imprisonment, were declared the future
	punishments of all pretenders to magic or witchcraft.</p>

	<p>Still for many years after this the superstition lingered both in
	England and Scotland, and in some districts is far from being extinct
	even at this day. But before we proceed to trace it any further than
	to its legal extinction, we have yet to see the frightful havoc it made
	in continental Europe from the commencement of the seventeenth to
	the middle of the eighteenth century. France, Germany, and Switzerland
	were the countries which suffered most from the epidemic.
	The number of victims in these countries during the sixteenth century
	has already been mentioned; but at the early part of the seventeenth,
	the numbers are so great, especially in Germany, that were
	they not to be found in the official records of the tribunals, it would
	be almost impossible to believe that mankind could ever have been
	so maddened and deluded. To use the words of the learned and indefatigable
	Horst,<a href="#fn35" id="fnm35" title="Zauberbibliothek..." class="fnmarker">35</a> “the world seemed to be like a large madhouse
	for witches and devils to play their antics in.” Satan was believed
	to be at every body’s call to raise the whirlwind, draw down the lightning,
	blight the productions of the earth, or destroy the health and
	paralyse the limbs of man. This belief, so insulting to the majesty
	and beneficence of the Creator, was shared by the most pious ministers
	of religion. Those who in their morning and evening prayers
	acknowledged the one true God, and praised him for the blessings of
	the seed-time and the harvest, were convinced that frail humanity
	could enter into a compact with the spirits of hell to subvert his laws
	and thwart all his merciful intentions. Successive popes, from Innocent
	VIII. downwards, promulgated this degrading doctrine, which
	spread so rapidly, that society seemed to be divided into two great
	factions, the bewitching and the bewitched.</p>
	
	<p>The commissioners named by Innocent VIII. to prosecute the
	witch-trials in Germany were, Jacob Sprenger, so notorious for his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"></a>work on demonology, entitled the <cite>Malleus Maleficarum, or Hammer
	to knock down Witches</cite>; Henry Institor, a learned jurisconsult;
	and the Bishop of Strasburgh. Bamberg, Trèves, Cologne, Paderborn,
	and Würzburg, were the chief seats of the commissioners, who,
	during their lives alone, condemned to the stake, on a very moderate
	calculation, upwards of three thousand victims. The number of
	witches so increased, that new commissioners were continually appointed
	in Germany, France, and Switzerland. In Spain and Portugal
	the Inquisition alone took cognisance of the crime. It is impossible
	to search the records of those dark, but now happily non-existing
	tribunals; but the mind recoils with affright even to form a guess of
	the multitudes who perished.</p>

	<p>The mode of trial in the other countries is more easily ascertained.
	Sprenger in Germany, and Bodinus and Delrio in France, have left
	but too ample a record of the atrocities committed in the much-abused
	names of justice and religion. Bodinus, of great repute and
	authority in the seventeenth century, says, “The trial of this offence
	must not be conducted like other crimes. Whoever adheres to the
	ordinary course of justice perverts the spirit of the law, both divine
	and human. He who is accused of sorcery should never be acquitted,
	unless the malice of the prosecutor be clearer than the sun; for it is
	so difficult to bring full proof of this secret crime, that out of a
	million of witches not one would be convicted if the usual course
	were followed!” Henri Boguet, a witch-finder, who styled himself
	“The Grand Judge of Witches for the Territory of St. Claude,” drew
	up a code for the guidance of all persons engaged in the witch-trials,
	consisting of seventy articles, quite as cruel as the code of Bodinus.
	In this document he affirms, that a mere suspicion of witchcraft
	justifies the immediate arrest and torture of the suspected person. If
	the prisoner muttered, looked on the ground, and did not shed any
	tears, all these were proofs positive of guilt! In all cases of witchcraft,
	the evidence of the child ought to be taken against its parent;
	and persons of notoriously bad character, although not to be believed
	upon their oaths on the ordinary occasions of dispute that might arise
	between man and man, were to be believed, if they swore that any person
	had bewitched them! Who, when he hears that this diabolical
	doctrine was the universally received opinion of the ecclesiastical and
	civil authorities, can wonder that thousands upon thousands of unhappy
	persons should be brought to the stake? that Cologne should
	for many years burn its three hundred witches annually? the district
	of Bamberg its four hundred? Nuremberg, Geneva, Paris, Toulouse,
	Lyons, and other cities, their two hundred?</p>

	<p>A few of these trials may be cited, taking them in the order of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"></a>priority, as they occurred in different parts of the Continent. In 1595,
	an old woman residing in a village near Constance, angry at not being
	invited to share the sports of the country people on a day of public
	rejoicing, was heard to mutter something to herself, and was afterwards
	seen to proceed through the fields towards a hill, where she was
	lost sight of. A violent thunder-storm arose about two hours afterwards,
	which wet the dancers to the skin, and did considerable damage
	to the plantations. This woman, suspected before of witchcraft, was
	seized and imprisoned, and accused of having raised the storm, by
	filling a hole with wine, and stirring it about with a stick. She was
	tortured till she confessed, and was burned alive the next evening.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>About the same time two sorcerers in Toulouse were accused of
	having dragged a crucifix about the streets at midnight, stopping
	at times to spit upon and kick it, and uttering at intervals an exorcism
	to raise the devil. The next day a hail-storm did considerable
	damage to the crops; and a girl, the daughter of a shoemaker in the
	town, remembered to have heard in the night the execrations of the
	wizards. Her story led to their arrest. The usual means to produce
	confession were resorted to. The wizards owned that they could raise
	tempests whenever they pleased, and named several persons who possessed
	similar powers. They were hanged, and then burned in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"></a>market-place, and seven of the persons they had mentioned shared the
	same fate.</p>

	<p>Hoppo and Stadlin, two noted wizards of Germany, were executed
	in 1599. They implicated twenty or thirty witches, who went about
	causing women to miscarry, bringing down the lightning of heaven,
	and making maidens bring forth toads. To this latter fact several
	girls were found to swear most positively! Stadlin confessed that he
	had killed seven infants in the womb of one woman.</p>

	<p>Bodinus highly praises the exertions of a witch-finder named Nider,
	in France, who prosecuted so many that he could not calculate
	them. Some of these witches could, by a single word, cause people to
	fall down dead; others made women go with child three years instead
	of nine months; while others, by certain invocations and ceremonies,
	could turn the faces of their enemies upside down, or twist them round
	to their backs. Although no witness was ever procured who saw persons
	in this horrible state, the witches confessed that they had the
	power and exercised it. Nothing more was wanting to ensure the stake.</p>

	<p>At Amsterdam a crazy girl confessed that she could cause sterility
	in cattle, and bewitch pigs and poultry by merely repeating the magic
	words <em>Turius und Shurius Inturius</em>! She was hanged and burned.
	Another woman in the same city, named Kornelis van Purmerund,
	was arrested in consequence of some disclosures the former had made.
	A witness came forward and swore that she one day looked through
	the window of her hut, and saw Kornelis sitting before a fire muttering
	something to the devil. She was sure it was to the devil, because
	she heard him answer her. Shortly afterwards twelve black cats
	ascended out of the floor, and danced on their hind legs around the
	witch for the space of about half an hour. They then vanished with
	a horrid noise, and leaving a disagreeable smell behind them. She
	also was hanged and burned.</p>

	<p>At Bamberg, in Bavaria, the executions from the year 1610 to
	1640 were at the rate of about a hundred annually. One woman,
	suspected of witchcraft, was seized because, having immoderately
	praised the beauty of a child, it had shortly afterwards fallen ill and
	died. She confessed upon the rack that the devil had given her the
	power to work evil upon those she hated, by speaking words in their
	praise. If she said with unwonted fervour, “What a strong man!”
	“What a lovely woman!” “What a sweet child!” the devil understood
	her, and afflicted them with diseases immediately. It is quite
	unnecessary to state the end of this poor creature. Many women
	were executed for causing strange substances to lodge in the bodies
	of those who offended them. Bits of wood, nails, hair, egg-shells,
	bits of glass, shreds of linen and woollen cloth, pebbles, and even hot
	<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"></a>cinders and knives, were the articles generally chosen. These were
	believed to remain in the body till the witches confessed or were
	executed, when they were voided from the bowels, or by the mouth,
	nostrils, or ears. Modern physicians have often had cases of a similar
	description under their care, where girls have swallowed needles,
	which have been voided on the arms, legs, and other parts of the
	body. But the science of that day could not account for these phenomena
	otherwise than by the power of the devil; and every needle
	swallowed by a servant-maid cost an old woman her life. Nay, if no
	more than one suffered in consequence, the district might think itself
	fortunate. The commissioners seldom stopped short at one victim.
	The revelations of the rack in most cases implicated half a score.</p>

	<p>Of all the records of the witch-trials preserved for the wonder
	of succeeding ages, that of Würzburg, from 1627 to 1629, is the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"></a>most frightful. Hauber, who has preserved this list in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta et
	Scripta Magica</cite>, says, in a note at the end, that it is far from complete,
	and that there were a great many other burnings too numerous
	to specify. This record, which relates to the city only, and not to
	the province of Würzburg, contains the names of one hundred and
	fifty-seven persons who were burned in two years in twenty-nine
	burnings, averaging from five to six at a time. The list comprises
	three play-actors, four innkeepers, three common councilmen of
	Würzburg, fourteen vicars of the cathedral, the burgomaster’s lady,
	an apothecary’s wife and daughter, two choristers of the cathedral,
	Göbel Babelin, the prettiest girl in the town, and the wife, the two
	little sons and the daughter of the councillor Stolzenberg. Rich and
	poor, young and old, suffered alike. At the seventh of these recorded
	burnings, the victims are described as a wandering boy, twelve years
	of age, and four strange men and women found sleeping in the
	market-place. Thirty-two of the whole number appear to have been
	vagrants, of both sexes, who, failing to give a satisfactory account
	of themselves, were accused and found guilty of witchcraft. The
	number of children on the list is horrible to think upon. The thirteenth
	and fourteenth burnings comprised four persons, who are
	stated to have been a little maiden nine years of age, a maiden still
	less, her sister, their mother, and their aunt, a pretty young woman
	of twenty-four. At the eighteenth burning the victims were two
	boys of twelve, and a girl of fifteen; at the nineteenth, the young
	heir of the noble house of Rotenhahn, aged nine, and two other boys,
	one aged ten, and the other twelve. Among other entries appear the
	names of Baunach, the fattest, and Steinacher, the richest burgher
	in Würzburg. What tended to keep up the delusion in this unhappy
	city, and, indeed, all over Europe, was the number of hypochondriac
	and diseased persons who came voluntarily forward and made confession
	of witchcraft. Several of the victims in the foregoing list
	had only themselves to blame for their fate. Many again, including
	the apothecary’s wife and daughter already mentioned, pretended to
	sorcery, and sold poisons, or attempted by means of charms and
	incantations to raise the devil. But throughout all this fearful period
	the delusion of the criminals was as great as that of the judges.
	Depraved persons who in ordinary times would have been thieves or
	murderers, added the desire of sorcery to their depravity, sometimes
	with the hope of acquiring power over their fellows, and sometimes
	with the hope of securing impunity in this world by the protection
	of Satan. One of the persons executed at the first burning, a prostitute,
	was heard repeating the exorcism which was supposed to
	have the power of raising the arch enemy in the form of a goat.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"></a>This precious specimen of human folly has been preserved by Horst
	in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zauberbibliothek</cite>. It ran as follows, and was to be repeated
	slowly, with many ceremonies and wavings of the hand:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Lalle, Bachera, Magotte, Baphia, Dajam,</p>
		<p>Vagoth Heneche Ammi Nagaz, Adomator</p>
		<p>Raphael Immanuel Christus, Tetragrammaton</p>
		<p>Agra Jod Loi. König! König!”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">The two last words were uttered quickly, and with a sort of scream,
	and were supposed to be highly agreeable to Satan, who loved to be
	called a king. If he did not appear immediately, it was necessary to
	repeat a further exorcism. The one in greatest repute was as follows,
	and was to be read backwards, with the exception of the last two
	words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Anion, Lalle, Sabolos, Sado, Pater, Aziel</p>
		<p>Adonai Sado Vagoth Agra, Jod,</p>
		<p>Baphra! Komm! Komm!”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">When the witch wanted to get rid of the devil, who was sometimes
	in the habit of prolonging his visits to an unconscionable length, she
	had only to repeat the following, also backwards, when he generally
	disappeared, leaving behind him a suffocating smell:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Zellianelle Heotti Bonus Vagotha</p>
		<p>Plisos sother osech unicus Beelzebub</p>
		<p>Dax! Komm! Komm!”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">This nonsensical jargon soon became known to all the idle and foolish
	boys of Germany. Many an unhappy urchin, who in a youthful
	frolic had repeated it, paid for his folly the penalty of his life.
	Three, whose ages varied from ten to fifteen, were burned alive at
	Würzburg for no other offence. Of course every other boy in the
	city became still more convinced of the power of the charm. One
	boy confessed that he would willingly have sold himself to the devil,
	if he could have raised him, for a good dinner and cakes every day of
	his life, and a pony to ride upon. This luxurious youngster, instead
	of being horsewhipped for his folly, was hanged and burned.</p>
	
	<p>The small district of Lindheim was, if possible, even more notorious
	than Würzburg for the number of its witch-burnings. In the
	year 1633 a famous witch, named Pomp Anna, who could cause her
	foes to fall sick by merely looking at them, was discovered and
	burned, along with three of her companions. Every year in this
	parish, consisting at most of a thousand persons, the average number
	of executions was five. Between the years 1660 and 1664, the
	number consumed was thirty. If the executions all over Germany
	had been in this frightful proportion, hardly a family could have
	escaped losing one of its members.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"></a>In 1627, a ballad entitled the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Druten Zeitung</cite>, or the <cite>Witches’
	Gazette</cite>, was very popular in Germany. It detailed, according to the
	title-page of a copy printed at Smalcald in 1627, “An account of the
	remarkable events which took place in Franconia, Bamberg, and
	Würzburg, with those wretches who from avarice or ambition have
	sold themselves to the devil, and how they had their reward at last:
	set to music, and to be sung to the tune of Dorothea.” The sufferings
	of the witches at the stake are explained in it with great minuteness,
	the poet waxing extremely witty when he describes the horrible
	contortions of pain upon their countenances, and the shrieks that rent
	the air when any one of more than common guilt was burned alive.
	A trick resorted to in order to force one witch to confess, is told in
	this doggrel as an excellent joke. As she obstinately refused to own
	that she was in league with the powers of evil, the commissioners
	suggested that the hangman should dress himself in a bear’s skin,
	with the horns, tail, and all the et-ceteras, and in this form penetrate
	into her dungeon. The woman, in the darkness of her cell, could
	not detect the imposture, aided as it was by her own superstitious
	fears. She thought she was actually in the presence of the prince of
	hell; and when she was told to keep up her courage, and that she
	should be relieved from the power of her enemies, she fell on her
	knees before the supposed devil, and swore to dedicate herself hereafter,
	body and soul, to his service. Germany is, perhaps, the only
	country in Europe where the delusion was so great as to have made
	such detestable verses as these the favourites of the people:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p class="i2">“Man shickt ein Henkersknecht</p>
			<p>Zu ihr in Gefängniss n’unter,</p>
			<p class="i2">Den man hat kleidet recht,</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"></a>This rare poet adds, that in making such an appeal to the hangman,
	the witch never imagined the roast that was to be made of her,
	and puts in, by way of parenthesis, “was not that fine fun!—<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">was das
	war für ein Spiel!</em>” As feathers thrown into the air shew how the
	wind blows, so this trumpery ballad serves to shew the current of
	popular feeling at the time of its composition.</p>

	<p>All readers of history are familiar with the celebrated trial of the
	Maréchale d’Ancre, who was executed in Paris in the year 1617.
	Although witchcraft was one of the accusations brought against her,
	the real crime for which she suffered was her ascendency over the
	mind of Mary of Medicis, and the consequent influence she exercised
	indirectly over the unworthy king, Louis XIII. Her coachman gave
	evidence that she had sacrificed a cock at midnight in one of the
	churches, and others swore they had seen her go secretly into the
	house of a noted witch named Isabella. When asked by what means
	she had acquired so extraordinary an influence over the mind of the
	Queen Mother, she replied boldly that she exercised no other power
	over her than that which a strong mind can always exercise over the
	weak. She died with great firmness.</p>

	<p>In two years afterwards, scenes far more horrible than any that
	had yet taken place in France were enacted at Labourt, at the foot of
	the Pyrenees. The parliament of Bourdeaux, scandalised at the
	number of witches who were said to infest Labourt and its neighbourhood,
	deputed one of its own members, the noted Pierre de
	l’Ancre, and its president, Espaignel, to inquire into the matter, with
	full powers to punish the offenders. They arrived at Labourt in
	May, 1619. De l’Ancre wrote a book setting forth all his great
	deeds in this battle against the powers of evil. It is full of obscenity
	and absurdity, but the facts may be relied on as far as they relate to
	the number of trials and executions, and the strange confessions
	which torture forced from the unhappy criminals.</p>

	<p>De l’Ancre states as a reason why so many witches were to be found
	at Labourt, that the country was mountainous and sterile! He discovered
	many of them from their partiality to smoking tobacco. It
	may be inferred from this that he was of the opinion of King James,
	that tobacco was the “devil’s weed.” When the commission first
	sat, the number of persons brought to trial was about forty a day.
	The acquittals did not average so many as five per cent. All the
	witches confessed that they had been present at the great Domdaniel,
	or Sabbath. At these saturnalia the devil sat upon a large gilded
	throne, sometimes in the form of a goat; sometimes as a gentleman,
	dressed all in black, with boots, spurs, and sword; and very often as
	a shapeless mass, resembling the trunk of a blasted tree, seen
	<a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"></a>indistinctly amid the darkness. They generally proceeded to the Domdaniel,
	riding on spits, pitchforks, or broomsticks, and on their
	arrival indulged with the fiends in every species of debauchery.
	Upon one occasion they had had the audacity to celebrate this festival
	in the very heart of the city of Bourdeaux. The throne of the arch
	fiend was placed in the middle of the Place de Gallienne, and the
	whole space was covered with the multitude of witches and wizards
	who flocked to it from far and near, some arriving even from distant
	Scotland.</p>

	<p>After two hundred poor wretches had been hanged and burned,
	there seemed no diminution in the number of criminals to be tried.
	Many of the latter were asked upon the rack what Satan had said
	when he found that the commissioners were proceeding with such
	severity? The general reply was, that he did not seem to care much
	about it. Some of them asserted that they had boldly reproached
	him for suffering the execution of their friends, saying, “<em>Out upon
	thee, false fiend! thy promise was that they should not die! Look, how
	thou hast kept thy word! They have been burned, and are a heap of
	ashes!</em>” Upon these occasions he was never offended: he would
	give orders that the sports of the Domdaniel should cease, and producing
	illusory fires that did not burn, he encouraged them to walk
	through, assuring them that the fires lighted by the executioner gave
	no more pain than those. They would then ask him, where their
	friends were, since they had not suffered; to which the “Father of
	Lies” invariably replied, that they were happy in a far country, and
	could see and hear all that was then passing; and that, if they
	called by name those they wished to converse with, they might hear
	their voices in reply. Satan then imitated the voices of the defunct
	witches so successfully that they were all deceived. Having
	answered all objections, the orgies recommenced and lasted till the
	cock crew.</p>

	<p>De l’Ancre was also very zealous in the trial of unhappy monomaniacs
	for the crime of lycanthropy. Several who were arrested
	confessed, without being tortured, that they were <em>weir-wolves</em>, and
	that at night they rushed out among the flocks and herds killing and
	devouring. One young man at Besançon, with the full consciousness
	of the awful fate that awaited him, voluntarily gave himself up to
	the commissioner Espaignel, and confessed that he was the servant
	of a strong fiend, who was known by the name of “Lord of the
	Forests:” by his power he was transformed into the likeness of a
	wolf. The “Lord of the Forests” assumed the same shape; but was
	much larger, fiercer, and stronger. They prowled about the pastures
	together at midnight, strangling the watch-dogs that defended the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"></a>folds, and killing more sheep than they could devour. He felt, he
	said, a fierce pleasure in these excursions, and howled in excess of
	joy as he tore with his fangs the warm flesh of the sheep asunder.
	This youth was not alone in this horrid confession; many others
	voluntarily owned that they were <em>weir-wolves</em>, and many more were
	forced by torture to make the same avowal. Such criminals were
	thought to be too atrocious to be hanged first and then burned: they
	were generally sentenced to be burned alive, and their ashes to be
	scattered to the winds. Grave and learned doctors of divinity openly
	sustained the possibility of these transformations, relying mainly
	upon the history of Nebuchadnezzar. They could not imagine why,
	if he had been an ox, modern men could not become wolves by
	Divine permission and the power of the devil. They also contended
	that, if men should confess, it was evidence enough, if there had
	been no other. Delrio mentions that one gentleman accused of
	lycanthropy was put to the torture no less than twenty times; but
	still he would not confess. An intoxicating draught was then given
	him, and under its influence he confessed that he was a <em>weir-wolf</em>.
	Delrio cites this to shew the extreme equity of the commissioners.
	They never burned any body till he confessed; and if one course of
	torture would not suffice, their patience was not exhausted, and they
	tried him again and again, even to the twentieth time! Well may
	we exclaim, when such atrocities have been committed in the name
	of religion,</p>
	
	<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p>“Quel lion, quel tigre égale en cruauté,</p>
		<p>Une injuste fureur qu’arme la piété?”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>The trial of the unhappy Urbain Grandier, the curate of Loudun,
	for bewitching a number of girls in the convent of the Ursulines in
	that town, was, like that of the Maréchale d’Ancre, an accusation
	resorted to by his enemies to ruin one against whom no other charge
	could be brought so readily. This noted affair, which kept France
	in commotion for months, and the true character of which was
	known even at that time, merits no more than a passing notice in
	this place. It did not spring from the epidemic dread of sorcery then
	so prevalent, but was carried on by wretched intriguers, who had
	sworn to have the life of their foe. Such a charge could not be
	refuted in 1634: the accused could not, as Bodinus expresses it,
	“make the malice of the prosecutors more clear than the sun;” and
	his own denial, however intelligible, honest, and straightforward,
	was held as nothing in refutation of the testimony of the crazy
	women who imagined themselves bewitched. The more absurd and
	contradictory their assertions, the stronger the argument employed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"></a>by his enemies that the devil was in them. He was burned alive,
	under circumstances of great cruelty.<a href="#fn37" id="fnm37" title="A very graphic account..." class="fnmarker">37</a></p>

	<p>A singular instance of the epidemic fear of witchcraft occurred at
	Lille, in 1639. A pious but not very sane lady, named Antoinette
	Bourignon, founded a school, or <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hospice</em>, in that city. One day, on
	entering the schoolroom, she imagined that she saw a great number
	of little black angels flying about the heads of the children. In great
	alarm she told her pupils of what she had seen, warning them to beware
	of the devil whose imps were hovering about them. The foolish
	woman continued daily to repeat the same story, and Satan and his
	power became the only subject of conversation, not only between the
	girls themselves, but between them and their instructors. One of
	them at this time ran away from the school. On being brought back
	and interrogated, she said she had not run away, but had been carried
	away by the devil; she was a witch, and had been one since the
	age of seven. Some other little girls in the school went into fits at
	this announcement, and, on their recovery, confessed that they also
	were witches. At last the whole of them, to the number of fifty,
	worked upon each other’s imaginations to such a degree that they
	also confessed that they were witches—that they attended the Domdaniel,
	or meeting of the fiends—that they could ride through the
	air on broom-sticks, feast on infants’ flesh, or creep through a
	key-hole.</p>

	<p>The citizens of Lille were astounded at these disclosures. The
	clergy hastened to investigate the matter; many of them, to their
	credit, openly expressed their opinion that the whole affair was an imposture—not
	so the majority; they strenuously insisted that the confessions
	of the children were valid, and that it was necessary to make an
	example by burning them all for witches. The poor parents, alarmed
	for their offspring, implored the examining Capuchins with tears
	in their eyes to save their young lives, insisting that they were
	bewitched, and not bewitching. This opinion also gained ground in
	the town. Antoinette Bourignon, who had put these absurd notions
	into the heads of the children, was accused of witchcraft, and examined
	before the council. The circumstances of the case seemed so unfavourable
	towards her that she would not stay for a second examination.
	Disguising herself as she best could, she hastened out of Lille
	and escaped pursuit. If she had remained four hours longer, she
	<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"></a>would have been burned by judicial sentence as a witch and a heretic.
	It is to be hoped that, wherever she went, she learned the danger of
	tampering with youthful minds, and was never again entrusted with
	the management of children.</p>

	<p>The Duke of Brunswick and the Elector of Menz were struck with
	the great cruelty exercised in the torture of suspected persons, and
	convinced, at the same time, that no righteous judge would consider
	a confession extorted by pain, and contradictory in itself, as sufficient
	evidence to justify the execution of any accused person. It is related
	of the Duke of Brunswick that he invited two learned Jesuits to his
	house, who were known to entertain strong opinions upon the subject
	of witchcraft, with a view of shewing them the cruelty and absurdity
	of such practices. A woman lay in the dungeon of the city accused of
	witchcraft, and the duke, having given previous instructions to the
	officiating torturers, went with the two Jesuits to hear her confession.
	By a series of artful leading questions the poor creature, in
	the extremity of her anguish, was induced to confess that she had often
	attended the sabbath of the fiends upon the Brocken; that she had
	seen two Jesuits there, who had made themselves notorious, even
	among witches, for their abominations; that she had seen them
	assume the form of goats, wolves, and other animals; and that many
	noted witches had borne them five, six, and seven children at a
	birth, who had heads like toads, and legs like spiders. Being asked
	if the Jesuits were far from her, she replied that they were in the
	room beside her. The Duke of Brunswick led his astounded friends
	away, and explained the stratagem. This was convincing proof to
	both of them that thousands of persons had suffered unjustly; they
	knew their own innocence, and shuddered to think what their fate
	might have been if an enemy instead of a friend had put such a confession
	into the mouth of a criminal. One of these Jesuits was Frederick
	Spee, the author of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cautio Criminalis</cite>, published in 1631.
	This work, exposing the horrors of the witch-trials, had a most salutary
	effect in Germany: Schonbrunn, Archbishop and Elector of
	Menz, abolished the torture entirely within his dominions, and his
	example was imitated by the Duke of Brunswick and other potentates.
	The number of supposed witches immediately diminished, and the
	violence of the mania began to subside. The Elector of Brandenburg
	issued a rescript, in 1654, with respect to the case of Anna of
	Ellerbrock, a supposed witch, forbidding the use of torture, and stigmatising
	the swimming of witches as an unjust, cruel, and deceitful
	test.</p>

	<p>This was the beginning of the dawn after the long-protracted
	darkness. The tribunals no longer condemned witches to execution
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"></a>by hundreds in a year. Würzburg, the grand theatre of the burnings,
	burned but one where, forty years previously, it had burned three
	score. From 1660 to 1670 the electoral chambers, in all parts of
	Germany, constantly commuted the sentence of death passed by the
	provincial tribunals into imprisonment for life, or burning on the
	cheek.</p>

	<p>A truer philosophy had gradually disabused the public mind.
	Learned men freed themselves from the trammels of a debasing superstition,
	and governments, both civil and ecclesiastical, repressed
	the popular delusion they had so long encouraged. The parliament
	of Normandy condemned a number of women to death, in the year
	1670, on the old charge of riding on broomsticks to the Domdaniel;
	but Louis XIV. commuted the sentence into banishment for life. The
	parliament remonstrated, and sent the king the following remarkable
	request. The reader will perhaps be glad to see this document at
	length. It is of importance, as the last effort of a legislative assembly
	to uphold this great error; and the arguments they used and the
	instances they quoted are in the highest degree curious. It reflects
	honour upon the memory of Louis XIV. that he was not swayed
	by it.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p class="small_all_caps"><a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"></a>“REQUEST OF THE PARLIAMENT OF ROUEN TO THE KING, IN 1670.</p>

		<p>“<span class="first_word">Sire</span>,—Emboldened by the authority which your majesty has
		committed into our hands in the province of Normandy, to try and
		punish offences, and more particularly those offences of the nature of
		witchcraft, which tend to the destruction of religion and the ruin of
		nations, we, your parliament, remonstrate humbly with your majesty
		upon certain cases of this kind which have been lately brought before
		us. We cannot permit the letter addressed by your majesty’s command
		to the attorney-general of this district, for the reprieve of certain
		persons condemned to death for witchcraft, and for the staying
		of proceedings in several other cases, to remain unnoticed, and without
		remarking upon the consequences which may ensue. There is
		also a letter from your secretary of state, declaring your majesty’s
		intention to commute the punishment of these criminals into one of
		perpetual banishment, and to submit to the opinion of the procureur-general,
		and of the most learned members of the parliament of Paris,
		whether, in the matter of witchcraft, the jurisprudence of the parliament
		of Rouen is to be followed in preference to that of the parliament
		of Paris, and of the other parliaments of the kingdom which
		judge differently.</p>

		<p>“Although by the ordinances of the kings your predecessors, parliaments
		have been forbidden to pay any attention to <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettres de cachet</em>;
		we, nevertheless, from the knowledge which we have, in common
		with the whole kingdom, of the care bestowed by your majesty for
		the good of your subjects, and from the submission and obedience to
		your commandments which we have always manifested, have stayed
		all proceedings, in conformity to your orders; hoping that your majesty,
		considering the importance of the crime of witchcraft, and the
		consequences likely to ensue from its impunity, will be graciously
		pleased to grant us once more your permission to continue the trials,
		and execute judgment upon those found guilty. And as, since we
		received the letter of your secretary of state, we have also been made
		acquainted with the determination of your majesty, not only to commute
		the sentence of death passed upon these witches into one of
		perpetual banishment from the province, but to re-establish them in
		the possession of their goods and chattels, and of their good fame and
		character, your parliament have thought it their duty, on occasion of
		these crimes, the greatest which men can commit, to make you
		acquainted with the general and uniform feelings of the people of
		this province with regard to them; it being, moreover, a question in
		which are concerned the glory of God and the relief of your suffering
		subjects, who groan under their fears from the threats and menaces of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"></a>this sort of persons, and who feel the effects of them every day in the
		mortal and extraordinary maladies which attack them, and the surprising
		damage and loss of their possessions.</p>

		<p>“Your majesty knows well that there is no crime so opposed to
		the commands of God as witchcraft, which destroys the very foundation
		of religion, and draws strange abominations after it. It is for
		this reason, sire, that the Scriptures pronounce the punishment of
		death against offenders, and that the Church and the holy fathers
		have fulminated their anathemas, and that canonical decisions have
		one and all decreed the most severe punishments, to deter from this
		crime; and that the Church of France, animated by the piety of the
		kings your predecessors, has expressed so great a horror at it, that,
		not judging the punishment of perpetual imprisonment, the highest
		it has the power to inflict, sufficiently severe, it has left such criminals
		to be dealt with by the secular power.</p>

		<p>“It has been the general feeling of all nations that such criminals
		ought to be condemned to death, and all the ancients were of the
		same opinion. The law of the ‘Twelve Tables,’ which was the principal
		of the Roman laws, ordains the same punishment. All juris-consults
		agreed in it, as well as the constitutions of the emperors, and
		more especially those of Constantine and Theodosius, who, enlightened
		by the Gospel, not only renewed the same punishment, but also deprived,
		expressly, all persons found guilty of witchcraft of the right
		of appeal, and declared them to be unworthy of a prince’s mercy. And
		Charles VIII., sire, inspired by the same sentiments, passed that
		beautiful and severe ordinance (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cette belle et sévère ordonnance</em>), which
		enjoined the judges to punish witches according to the exigencies of
		the case, under a penalty of being themselves fined or imprisoned, or
		dismissed from their office; and decreed, at the same time, that all
		persons who refused to denounce a witch, should be punished as accomplices;
		and that all, on the contrary, who gave evidence against
		one should be rewarded.</p>

		<p>“From these considerations, sire, and in the execution of so holy
		an ordinance, your parliaments, by their decrees, proportion their
		punishments to the guilt of the offenders; and your parliament of
		Normandy has never, until the present time, found that its practice
		was different from that of other courts; for all the books which treat
		upon this matter cite an infinite number of decrees condemning
		witches to be burnt, or broken on the wheel, or to other punishments.
		The following are examples:—In the time of Chilperic, as may be
		seen in Gregory of Tours, <abbr title="book six">b. vi.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 35 of his <cite>History of France</cite>; all the
		decrees of the parliament of Paris passed according to, and in conformity
		with, this ancient jurisprudence of the kingdom, cited by
		<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"></a>Imbert, in his <cite>Judicial Practice</cite>; all those cited by Monstrelet, in
		1459, against the witches of Artois; the decrees of the same parliament,
		of the 13th of October 1573, against Mary Le Fief, native of
		Saumur; of the 21st of October 1596, against the Sieur de Beaumont,
		who pleaded, in his defence, that he had only sought the aid of the
		devil for the purpose of unbewitching the afflicted and of curing
		diseases; of the 4th of July 1606, against Francis du Bose; of the
		20th of July 1582, against Abel de la Rue, native of Coulommiers; of
		the 2d of October 1593, against Rousseau and his daughter; of 1608,
		against another Rousseau and one Peley, for witchcraft and adoration
		of the devil at the Sabbath, under the figure of a he-goat, as confessed
		by them; the decree of 4th of February 1615, against Leclerc, who appealed
		from the sentence of the parliament of Orleans, and who was
		condemned for having attended the Sabbath, and confessed, as well
		as two of his accomplices, who died in prison, that he had adored the
		devil, renounced his baptism and his faith in God, danced the witches’
		dance, and offered up unholy sacrifices; the decrees of the 6th of May
		1616, against a man named Leger, on a similar accusation; the pardon
		granted by Charles IX. to Trois Echelles, upon condition of revealing
		his accomplices, but afterwards revoked for renewed sorcery
		on his part; the decree of the parliament of Paris, cited by Mornac
		in 1595; the judgments passed in consequence of the commission
		given by Henry IV. to the Sieur de l’Ancre, councillor of the parliament
		of Bourdeaux; of the 20th of March 1619, against Etienne
		Audibert; those passed by the chamber of Nerac, on the 26th of June
		1620, against several witches; those passed by the parliament of Toulouse
		in 1577, as cited by Gregory Tolosanus, against four hundred
		persons accused of this crime, and who were all marked with the sign
		of the devil. Besides all these, we might recal to your majesty’s recollection
		the various decrees of the parliament of Provence, especially
		in the case of Gaufrédy in 1611; the decrees of the parliament of
		Dijon, and those of the parliament of Rennes, following the example
		of the condemnation of the Marshal de Rays, who was burned in
		1441, for the crime of witchcraft, in presence of the Duke of Brittany;—all
		these examples, sire, prove that the accusation of witchcraft
		has always been punished with death by the parliaments of your
		kingdom, and justify the uniformity of their practice.</p>

		<p>“These, sire, are the motives upon which your parliament of Normandy
		has acted in decreeing the punishment of death against the
		persons lately brought before it for this crime. If it has happened
		that, on any occasion, these parliaments, and the parliament of Normandy
		among the rest, have condemned the guilty to a less punishment
		than that of death, it was for the reason that their guilt was
		<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"></a>not of the deepest dye; your majesty, and the kings your predecessors,
		having left full liberty to the various tribunals to whom they
		delegated the administration of justice, to decree such punishment
		as was warranted by the evidence brought before them.</p>

		<p>“After so many authorities, and punishments ordained by human
		and divine laws, we humbly supplicate your majesty to reflect once
		more upon the extraordinary results which proceed from the malevolence
		of this sort of people; on the deaths from unknown diseases,
		which are often the consequences of their menaces, on the loss of the
		goods and chattels of your subjects, on the proofs of guilt continually
		afforded by the insensibility of the marks upon the accused, on the
		sudden transportation of bodies from one place to another, on the
		sacrifices and nocturnal assemblies, and other facts, corroborated by
		the testimony of ancient and modern authors, and verified by so many
		eye-witnesses, composed partly of accomplices, and partly of people
		who had no interest in the trials beyond the love of truth, and confirmed,
		moreover, by the confessions of the accused parties themselves;
		and that, sire, with so much agreement and conformity between the
		different cases, that the most ignorant persons convicted of this crime
		have spoken to the same circumstances, and in nearly the same words,
		as the most celebrated authors who have written about it, all of which
		may be easily proved to your majesty’s satisfaction by the records of
		various trials before your parliaments.</p>

		<p>“These, sire, are truths so intimately bound up with the principles
		of our religion, that, extraordinary although they be, no person
		has been able to this time to call them in question. If some have
		cited, in opposition to these truths, the pretended canon of the
		Council of Ancyre, and a passage from St. Augustin, in a treatise
		upon the <cite>Spirit and the Soul</cite>, it has been without foundation; and it
		would be easy to convince your majesty that neither the one nor the
		other ought to be accounted of any authority; and, besides that, the
		canon, in this sense, would be contrary to the opinion of all succeeding
		councils of the Church, Cardinal Baronius, and all learned commentators
		agree that it is not to be found in any old edition. In
		effect, in those editions wherein it is found, it is in another language,
		and is in direct contradiction to the twenty-third canon of the same
		council, which condemns sorcery, according to all preceding constitutions.
		Even supposing that this canon was really promulgated by
		the Council of Ancyre, we must observe that it was issued in the
		second century, when the principal attention of the Church was directed
		to the destruction of paganism. For this reason, it condemns
		that class of women who said they could pass through the air, and
		over immense regions, with Diana and Herodias, and enjoins all
		<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"></a>preachers to teach the falsehood of such an opinion, in order to deter
		people from the worship of these false divinities; but it does not
		question the power of the devil over the human body, which is, in
		fact, proved by the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ himself. And with
		regard, sire, to the pretended passage of St. Augustin, everybody
		knows that it was not written by him, because the writer, whoever
		he was, cites Bœtius, who died more than eighty years after the time
		of St. Augustin. Besides, there is still more convincing proof in the
		fact, that the same father establishes the truth of witchcraft in all
		his writings, and more particularly in his <cite>City of God</cite>; and in his
		first volume, question the 25th, wherein he states that sorcery is a
		communion between man and the devil, which all good Christians
		ought to look upon with horror.</p>

		<p>“Taking all these things into consideration, sire, the officers of
		your parliament hope, from the justice of your majesty, that you will
		be graciously pleased to receive the humble remonstrances they have
		taken the liberty to make. They are compelled, for the acquittal of
		their own consciences and in discharge of their duty, to make known
		to your majesty, that the decrees they passed against the sorcerers
		and witches brought before them, were passed after a mature deliberation
		on the part of all the judges present, and that nothing has been
		done therein which is not conformable to the universal jurisprudence
		of the kingdom, and for the general welfare of your majesty’s subjects,
		of whom there is not one who can say that he is secure from
		the malevolence of such criminals. We therefore supplicate your
		majesty to suffer us to carry into effect the sentences we passed, and
		to proceed with the trial of the other persons accused of the same
		crime; and that the piety of your majesty will not suffer to be introduced
		during your reign an opinion contrary to the principles of that
		holy religion for which you have always employed so gloriously both
		your cares and your arms.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Louis, as we have already mentioned, paid no attention to this
	appeal. The lives of the old women were spared, and prosecutions
	for mere witchcraft, unconnected with other offences, were discontinued
	throughout France. In 1680 an act was passed for the punishment,
	not of witches, but of pretenders to witchcraft, fortune-tellers,
	divineresses, and poisoners.</p>

	<p>Thus the light broke in upon Germany, France, England, and
	Scotland about the same time, gradually growing clearer and clearer
	till the middle of the eighteenth century, when witchcraft was finally
	reckoned amongst exploded doctrines, and the belief in it confined to
	the uttermost vulgar. Twice, however, did the madness burst forth
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"></a>again as furious, while it lasted, as ever it had been. The first time
	in Sweden, in 1669, and the second in Germany so late as 1749. Both
	these instances merit particular mention. The first is one of the most
	extraordinary upon record,
	and for atrocity and absurdity
	is unsurpassed in the annals
	of any nation.</p>

	</div>

	<p>It having been reported
	to the king of Sweden that
	the little village of Mohra,
	in the province of Dalecarlia,
	was troubled exceedingly
	with witches, he appointed
	a commission of clergy and
	laymen to trace the rumour
	to its source, with full
	powers to punish the guilty.
	On the 12th of August 1669,
	the commissioners arrived
	in the bewitched village, to
	the great joy of the credulous
	inhabitants. On the following
	day the whole population,
	amounting to three
	thousand persons, assembled in the church. A sermon was preached,
	“declaring the miserable case of those people that suffered themselves
	to be deluded by the devil,” and fervent prayer was offered up that
	God would remove the scourge from among them.</p>

	<p>The whole assembly then adjourned to the rector’s house, filling
	all the street before it, when the king’s commission was read, charging
	every person who knew any thing of the witchery, to come forward
	and declare the truth. A passion of tears seized upon the multitude;
	men, women, and children began to weep and sob, and all
	promised to divulge what they had heard or knew. In this frame of
	mind they were dismissed to their homes. On the following day they
	were again called together, when the depositions of several persons
	were taken publicly before them all. The result was that seventy
	persons, including fifteen children, were taken into custody. Numbers
	also were arrested in the neighbouring district of Elfdale. Being put
	to the torture, they all confessed their guilt. They said they used to
	go to a gravel-pit, that lay hard by the cross-way, where they put a
	vest upon their heads, and danced “round and round and round
	about.” They then went to the cross-way, and called three times
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"></a>upon the devil; the first time in a low still voice; the second, somewhat
	louder; and the third, very loudly, with these words, “Antecessor,
	come, and carry us to Blockula!” This invocation never
	failed to bring him to their view. He generally appeared as a little
	old man, in a grey coat, with red and blue stockings, with exceedingly
	long garters. He had besides a very high-crowned hat, with bands
	of many-coloured linen enfolded about it, and a long red beard that
	hung down to his middle.</p>

	<p>The first question he put to them was, whether they would serve
	him soul and body? On their answering in the affirmative, he told
	them to make ready for the journey to Blockula. It was necessary to
	procure, in the first place, “some scrapings of altars and filings of
	church clocks.” Antecessor then gave them a horn with some salve
	in it, wherewith they anointed themselves. These preparations ended,
	he brought beasts for them to ride upon,—horses, asses, goats, and
	monkeys; and giving them a saddle, a hammer, and a nail, uttered
	the word of command, and away they went. Nothing stopped them.
	They flew over churches, high walls, rocks, and mountains, until they
	came to the green meadow where Blockula was situated. Upon these
	occasions they carried as many children with them as they could; for
	the devil, they said, “did plague and whip them if they did not procure
	him children, insomuch that they had no peace or quiet for him.”</p>

	<p>Many parents corroborated a part of this evidence, stating that
	their children had repeatedly told them that they had been carried
	away in the night to Blockula, where the devil had beaten them
	black and blue. They had seen the marks in the morning, but they
	soon disappeared. One little girl was examined, who swore positively
	that she was carried through the air by the witches, and when at a
	great height she uttered the holy name of Jesus. She immediately
	fell to the ground, and made a great hole in her side. “The devil,
	however, picked her up, healed her side, and carried her away to
	Blockula.” She added (and her mother confirmed her statement),
	that she had till that day “an exceeding great pain in her side.”
	This was a clencher, and the nail of conviction was driven home to
	the hearts of the judges.</p>

	<p>The place called Blockula, whither they were carried, was a large
	house, with a gate to it, “in a delicate meadow, whereof they could
	see no end.” There was a very long table in it, at which the witches
	sat down; and in other rooms “there were very lovely and delicate
	beds for them to sleep upon.”</p>

	<p>After a number of ceremonies had been performed, by which they
	bound themselves body and soul to the service of Antecessor, they
	sat down to a feast composed of broth, made of colworts and bacon,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"></a>oatmeal, bread and butter, milk and cheese. The devil always took
	the chair, and sometimes played to them on the harp or the fiddle
	while they were eating. After dinner they danced in a ring, sometimes
	naked, and sometimes in their clothes, cursing and swearing all
	the time. Some of the women added particulars too horrible and too
	obscene for repetition.</p>

	<p>Once the devil pretended to be dead, that he might see whether
	his people regretted him. They instantly set up a loud wail, and
	wept three tears each for him; at which he was so pleased, that he
	jumped up among them, and hugged in his arms those who had been
	most obstreperous in their sorrow.</p>

	<p>Such were the principal details given by the children, and corroborated
	by the confessions of the full-grown witches. Any thing
	more absurd was never before stated in a court of justice. Many of
	the accused contradicted themselves most palpably; but the commissioners
	gave no heed to discrepancies. One of them, the parson of
	the district, stated in the course of the inquiry, that on a particular
	night, which he mentioned, he had been afflicted with a headache so
	agonising, that he could not account for it otherwise than by supposing
	he was bewitched. In fact, he thought a score of witches
	must have been dancing on the crown of his head. This announcement
	excited great horror among the pious dames of the auditory,
	who loudly expressed their wonder that the devil should have power
	to hurt so good a man. One poor witch, who lay in the very jaws of
	death, confessed that she knew too well the cause of the minister’s
	headache. The devil had sent her with a sledge hammer and a large
	nail to drive into the good man’s skull. She had hammered at it for
	some time, but the skull was so enormously <em>thick</em>, that she made no
	impression upon it. Every hand was held up in astonishment. The
	pious minister blessed God that his skull was so solid, and he became
	renowned for his thick head all the days of his life. Whether the
	witch intended a joke does not appear, but she was looked upon as a
	criminal more than usually atrocious. Seventy persons were condemned
	to death on these so awful, yet so ridiculous confessions.
	Twenty-three of them were burned together in one fire in the village
	of Mohra, in the presence of thousands of delighted spectators. On
	the following day fifteen children were murdered in the same manner,
	offered up in sacrifice to the bloody Moloch of superstition. The remaining
	thirty-two were executed at the neighbouring town of Fahluna.
	Besides these, fifty-six children were found guilty of witchcraft
	in a minor degree, and sentenced to various punishments, such as
	running the gauntlet, imprisonment, and public whipping once a week
	for a twelvemonth.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"></a>Long after the occurrence of this case, it was cited as one of the
	most convincing proofs upon record of the prevalence of witchcraft.
	When men wish to construct or support a theory, how they torture
	facts into their service! The lying whimsies of a few sick children,
	encouraged by foolish parents, and drawn out by superstitious neighbours,
	were sufficient to set a country in a flame. If, instead of commissioners
	as deeply sunk in the slough of ignorance as the people
	they were sent amongst, there had been deputed a few men firm in
	courage and clear in understanding, how different would have been
	the result! Some of the poor children who were burned would have
	been sent to an infirmary; others would have been well flogged; the
	credulity of the parents would have been laughed at; and the lives
	of seventy persons spared. The belief in witchcraft remains in Sweden
	to this day; but happily the annals of that country present no more
	such instances of lamentable aberration of intellect as the one just
	cited.</p>

	<p>In New England, about the same time, the colonists were scared
	by similar stories of the antics of the devil. All at once a fear seized
	upon the multitude, and supposed criminals were arrested day after
	day in such numbers, that the prisons were found too small to contain
	them. A girl named Goodwin, the daughter of a mason, who was
	hypochondriac and subject to fits, imagined that an old Irish woman,
	named Glover, had bewitched her. Her two brothers, in whose constitutions
	there was apparently a predisposition to similar fits, went
	off in the same way, crying out that the devil and Dame Glover were
	tormenting them. At times their joints were so stiff that they could
	not be moved; while at others, said the neighbours, they were so
	flexible, that the bones appeared softened into sinews. The supposed
	witch was seized, and as she could not repeat the Lord’s Prayer without
	making a mistake in it, she was condemned and executed.</p>

	<p>But the popular excitement was not allayed. One victim was not
	enough; the people waited agape for new disclosures. Suddenly two
	hysteric girls in another family fell into fits daily, and the cry of
	witchcraft resounded from one end of the colony to the other. The
	feeling of suffocation in the throat, so common in cases of hysteria,
	was said by the patients to be caused by the devil himself, who had
	stuck balls in the windpipe to choke them. They felt the pricking of
	thorns in every part of the body, and one of them vomited needles.
	The case of these girls, who were the daughter and niece of a Mr.
	Parvis, the minister of a Calvinist chapel, excited so much attention,
	that all the weak women in the colony began to fancy themselves
	similarly afflicted. The more they brooded on it, the more convinced
	they became. The contagion of this mental disease was as great as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"></a>if it had been a pestilence. One after the other the women fainted
	away, asserting on their recovery that they had seen the spectres of
	witches. Where there were three or four girls in a family, they so
	worked each upon the diseased imagination of the other, that they
	fell into fits five or six times in a day. Some related that the devil
	himself appeared to them, bearing in his hand a parchment-roll, and
	promising that if they would sign an agreement, transferring to him
	their immortal souls, they should be immediately relieved from fits
	and all the ills of the flesh. Others asserted that they saw witches
	only, who made them similar promises, threatening that they should
	never be free from aches and pains till they had agreed to become the
	devil’s. When they refused, the witches pinched, or bit, or pricked
	them with long pins and needles. More than two hundred persons
	named by these mischievous visionaries were thrown into prison.
	They were of all ages and conditions of life, and many of them of
	exemplary character. No less than nineteen were condemned and
	executed before reason returned to the minds of the colonists. The
	most horrible part of this lamentable history is, that among the victims
	there was a little child only five years old. Some women swore
	that they had seen it repeatedly in company with the devil, and that
	it had bitten them often with its little teeth for refusing to sign a
	compact with the evil one. It can hardly increase our feelings of
	disgust and abhorrence when we learn that this insane community
	actually tried and executed a dog for the same offence!</p>

	<p>One man, named Cory, stoutly refused to plead to the preposterous
	indictment against him. As was the practice in such cases, he
	was pressed to death. It is told of the Sheriff of New England, who
	superintended the execution, that when this unhappy man thrust out
	his tongue in his mortal agony, he seized hold of a cane, and crammed
	it back again into the mouth. If ever there were a fiend in human
	form, it was this sheriff: a man who, if the truth were known, perhaps
	plumed himself upon his piety—thought he was doing God good
	service, and</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Arguing still in the firm belief of witchcraft, the bereaved people
	began to inquire, when they saw their dearest friends snatched away
	from them by these wide-spreading accusations, whether the whole
	proceedings were not carried on by the agency of the devil. Might
	not the great enemy have put false testimony into the mouths of the
	witnesses, or might not the witnesses be witches themselves? Every
	man who was in danger of losing his wife, his child, or his sister,
	embraced this doctrine with avidity. The revulsion was as sudden as
	the first frenzy. All at once, the colonists were convinced of their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"></a>error. The judges put a stop to the prosecutions, even of those who
	had confessed their guilt. The latter were no sooner at liberty than
	they retracted all they had said, and the greater number hardly remembered
	the avowals which agony had extorted from them. Eight
	persons, who had been tried and condemned, were set free; and gradually
	girls ceased to have fits and to talk of the persecutions of the
	devil. The judge who had condemned the first criminal executed on
	this charge, was so smitten with sorrow and humiliation at his folly,
	that he set apart the anniversary of that day as one of solemn penitence
	and fasting. He still clung to the belief in witchcraft; no new
	light had broken in upon him on that subject, but, happily for the
	community, the delusion had taken a merciful turn. The whole
	colony shared the feeling; the jurors on the different trials openly
	expressed their penitence in the churches; and those who had suffered
	were regarded as the victims, and not as the accomplices of
	Satan.</p>


	<p>It is related that the Indian tribes in New England were sorely
	puzzled at the infatuation of the settlers, and thought them either a
	race inferior to, or more sinful than the French colonists in the vicinity,
	amongst whom, as they remarked, “the Great Spirit sent no
	witches.”</p>

	<p>Returning again to the continent of Europe, we find that, after
	the year 1680, men became still wiser upon this subject. For twenty
	years the populace were left to their belief, but governments in general
	gave it no aliment in the shape of executions. The edict of Louis
	XIV. gave a blow to the superstition, from which it never recovered.
	The last execution in the Protestant cantons of Switzerland was at
	Geneva, in 1652. The various potentates of Germany, although they
	could not stay the trials, invariably commuted the sentence into
	imprisonment, in all cases where the pretended witch was accused of
	pure witchcraft, unconnected with any other crime. In the year 1701,
	Thomasius, the learned professor at the University of Halle, delivered
	his inaugural thesis, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Crimine Magiæ</cite> which struck another
	blow at the falling monster of popular error. But a faith so strong
	as that in witchcraft was not to be eradicated at once: the arguments
	of learned men did not penetrate to the villages and hamlets; but still
	they achieved great things; they rendered the belief an unworking
	faith, and prevented the supply of victims, on which for so many ages
	it had battened and grown strong.</p>

	<p>Once more the delusion broke out; like a wild beast wounded to
	the death, it collected all its remaining energies for the final convulsion,
	which was to shew how mighty it had once been. Germany,
	which had nursed the frightful error in its cradle, tended it on its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"></a>death-bed, and Würzburg, the scene of so many murders on the same
	pretext, was destined to be the scene of the last. That it might lose
	no portion of its bad renown, the last murder was as atrocious as the
	first. This case offers a great resemblance to that of the witches of
	Mohra and New England, except in the number of its victims. It
	happened so late as the year 1749, to the astonishment and disgust of
	the rest of Europe.</p>

	</div>

	<p>A number of young women in a convent at Würzburg fancied
	themselves bewitched; they felt, like all hysteric subjects, a sense of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"></a>suffocation in the throat. They went into fits repeatedly; and one
	of them, who had swallowed needles, evacuated them at abscesses,
	which formed in different parts of the body. The cry of sorcery was
	raised, and a young woman, named Maria Renata Sänger, was arrested
	on the charge of having leagued with the devil, to bewitch five
	of the young ladies. It was sworn on the trial that Maria had been
	frequently seen to clamber over the convent walls in the shape of a
	pig—that, proceeding to the cellar, she used to drink the best wine
	till she was intoxicated; and then start suddenly up in her own form.
	Other girls asserted that she used to prowl about the roof like a cat,
	and often penetrate into their chamber, and frighten them by her
	dreadful howlings. It was also said that she had been seen in the
	shape of a hare, milking the cows dry in the meadows belonging to
	the convent; that she used to perform as an actress on the boards of
	Drury Lane theatre in London, and, on the very same night, return
	upon a broomstick to Würzburg, and afflict the young ladies with
	pains in all their limbs. Upon this evidence she was condemned, and
	burned alive in the market-place of Würzburg.</p>

	<p>Here ends this frightful catalogue of murder and superstition.
	Since that day, the belief in witchcraft has fled from the populous
	abodes of men, and taken refuge in remote villages and districts too
	wild, rugged, and inhospitable to afford a resting-place for the foot
	of civilisation. Rude fishers and uneducated labourers still attribute
	every phenomenon of nature which they cannot account for, to the
	devil and witches. Catalepsy, that wondrous disease, is still thought
	by ignorant gossips to be the work of Satan; and hypochondriacs,
	uninformed by science of the nature of their malady, devoutly believe
	in the reality of their visions. The reader would hardly credit the
	extent of the delusion upon this subject in the very heart of England
	at this day. Many an old woman leads a life of misery from the unfeeling
	insults of her neighbours, who raise the scornful finger and
	hooting voice at her, because in her decrepitude she is ugly, spiteful,
	perhaps insane, and realises in her personal appearance the description
	preserved by tradition of the witches of yore. Even in the neighbourhood
	of great towns the taint remains of this once widely-spread
	contagion. If no victims fall beneath it, the enlightenment of the
	law is all that prevents a recurrence of scenes as horrid as those of
	the seventeenth century. Hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses
	could be found to swear to absurdities as great as those asserted by
	the infamous Matthew Hopkins.</p>

	<p>In the <cite>Annual Register</cite> for 1760, an instance of the belief in witchcraft
	is related, which shews how superstition lingers. A dispute arose
	in the little village of Glen, in Leicestershire, between two old women,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"></a>each of whom vehemently accused the other of witchcraft. The quarrel
	at last ran so high that a challenge ensued, and they both agreed
	to be tried by the ordeal of swimming. They accordingly stripped to
	their shifts—procured some men, who tied their thumbs and great
	toes together, cross-wise, and then, with a cart-rope about their middle,
	suffered themselves to be thrown into a pool of water. One of
	them sank immediately, but the other continued struggling a short
	time upon the surface of the water, which the mob deeming an infallible
	sign of her guilt, pulled her out, and insisted that she should
	immediately impeach all her accomplices in the craft. She accordingly
	told them that, in the neighbouring village of Burton, there
	were several old women as “much witches as she was.” Happily for
	her, this negative information was deemed sufficient, and a student
	in astrology, or “white-witch,” coming up at the time, the mob, by
	his direction, proceeded forthwith to Burton in search of all the delinquents.
	After a little consultation on their arrival, they went to
	the old woman’s house on whom they had fixed the strongest suspicion.
	The poor old creature on their approach locked the outer door,
	and from the window of an upstairs room asked what they wanted.
	They informed her that she was charged with being guilty of witchcraft,
	and that they were come to duck her; remonstrating with her
	at the same time upon the necessity of submission to the ordeal, that,
	if she were innocent, all the world might know it. Upon her persisting
	in a positive refusal to come down, they broke open the door and
	carried her out by force, to a deep gravel-pit full of water. They tied
	her thumbs and toes together and threw her into the water, where
	they kept her for several minutes, drawing her out and in two or
	three times by the rope round her middle. Not being able to satisfy
	themselves whether she were a witch or no, they at last let her go,
	or, more properly speaking, they left her on the bank to walk home
	by herself, if she ever recovered. Next day, they tried the same experiment
	upon another woman, and afterwards upon a third; but,
	fortunately, neither of the victims lost her life from this brutality.
	Many of the ringleaders in the outrage were apprehended during
	the week, and tried before the justices at quarter-sessions. Two of
	them were sentenced to stand in the pillory and to be imprisoned
	for a month; and as many as twenty more were fined in small
	sums for the assault, and bound over to keep the peace for a twelvemonth.</p>

	<p>“So late as the year 1785,” says Arnot, in his collection and
	abridgment of <cite>Criminal Trials in Scotland</cite>, “it was the custom among
	the sect of Seceders to read from the pulpit an annual confession of
	sins, national and personal; amongst the former of which was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186"></a>particularly mentioned the ‘Repeal by parliament of the penal statute
	against witches, contrary to the express laws of God.’”</p>

		<p class="caption">LADY HATTON’S HOUSE, CROSS STREET, HATTON GARDEN.</p>
	</div>
	

	<p>Many houses are still to be found in England with the horse-shoe
	(the grand preservative against witchcraft) nailed against the threshold.
	If any over-wise philosopher should attempt to remove them,
	the chances are that he would have more broken bones than thanks
	for his interference. Let any man walk into Cross Street, Hatton
	Garden, and from thence into Bleeding-heart Yard, and learn the
	tales still told and believed of one house in that neighbourhood, and
	he will ask himself in astonishment if such things can be in the nineteenth
	century. The witchcraft of Lady Hatton, the wife of the
	famous Sir Christopher, so renowned for his elegant dancing in the
	days of Elizabeth, is as devoutly believed as the Gospels. The room
	is to be seen where the devil seized her after the expiration of the contract
	he had made with her, and bore her away bodily to the pit of
	Tophet: the pump against which he dashed her is still pointed out,
	and the spot where her heart was found, after he had torn it out of
	her bosom with his iron claws, has received the name of Bleeding-heart
	Yard, in confirmation of the story. Whether the horse-shoe
	still remains upon the door of the haunted house, to keep away other
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"></a>witches, is uncertain. A former inmate relates that, “about twenty
	years ago, more than one old woman begged for admittance repeatedly,
	to satisfy themselves that it was in its proper place. One
	poor creature, apparently insane, and clothed in rags, came to the
	door with a tremendous double-knock, as loud as that of a fashionable
	footman, and walked straight along the passage to the horse-shoe.
	Great was the wonderment of the inmates, especially when the woman
	spat upon the horse-shoe, and expressed her sorrow that she could do
	no harm while it remained there. After spitting upon, and kicking
	it again and again, she coolly turned round and left the house,
	without saying a word to any body. This poor creature perhaps
	intended a joke, but the probability is that she imagined herself
	a witch. In Saffron Hill, where she resided, her ignorant neighbours
	gave her that character, and looked upon her with no little
	fear and aversion.”</p>

	<p>More than one example of the popular belief in witchcraft occurred
	in the neighbourhood of Hastings so lately as the year 1830. An aged
	woman, who resided in the Rope-walk of that town, was so repulsive
	in her appearance, that she was invariably accused of being a witch
	by all the ignorant people who knew her. She was bent completely
	double; and though very old, her eye was unusually bright and malignant.
	She wore a red cloak, and supported herself on a crutch:
	she was, to all outward appearance, the very <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</em> of a witch.
	So dear is power to the human heart, that this old woman actually
	encouraged the popular superstition; she took no pains to remove
	the ill impression, but seemed to delight that she, old and miserable
	as she was, could keep in awe so many happier and stronger fellow-creatures.
	Timid girls crouched with fear when they met her,
	and many would go a mile out of their way to avoid her. Like
	the witches of the olden time, she was not sparing of her curses
	against those who offended her. The child of a woman who resided
	within two doors of her was afflicted with lameness, and the mother
	constantly asserted that the old woman had bewitched her. All the
	neighbours credited the tale. It was believed, too, that she could
	assume the form of a cat. Many a harmless puss has been hunted
	almost to the death by mobs of men and boys, upon the supposition
	that the animal would start up before them in the true shape of
	Mother ——.</p>

	<p>In the same town there resided a fisherman, who was the object
	of unceasing persecution, because it was said that he had sold himself
	to the devil. It was currently reported that he could creep
	through a keyhole, and that he had made a witch of his daughter,
	in order that he might have the more power over his fellows. It was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"></a>also believed that he could sit on the points of pins and needles and
	feel no pain. His brother fishermen put him to this test whenever
	they had an opportunity. In the alehouses which he frequented,
	they often placed long needles in the cushions of the chairs in such a
	manner that he could not fail to pierce himself when he sat down.
	The result of these experiments tended to confirm their faith in his
	supernatural powers. It was asserted that he never flinched. Such
	was the popular feeling in the fashionable town of Hastings a few years
	ago; very probably it is the same now.</p>

	<p>In the north of England, the superstition lingers to an almost inconceivable
	extent. Lancashire abounds with witch-doctors, a set of
	quacks who pretend to cure diseases inflicted by the devil. The practices
	of these worthies may be judged of by the following case, reported
	in the <cite>Hertford Reformer</cite> of the 23d of June 1838. The witch-doctor
	alluded to is better known by the name of the <em>cunning man</em>, and has
	a large practice in the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham. According
	to the writer in the <cite>Reformer</cite>, the dupe, whose name is not mentioned,
	had been for about two years afflicted with a painful abscess,
	and had been prescribed for without relief by more than one medical
	gentleman. He was urged by some of his friends, not only in his
	own village but in neighbouring ones, to consult the witch-doctor, as
	they were convinced he was under some evil influence. He agreed,
	and sent his wife to the <em>cunning man</em>, who lived in New St. Swithin’s,
	in Lincoln. She was informed by this ignorant impostor that her
	husband’s disorder was an infliction of the devil, occasioned by his
	next-door neighbours, who had made use of certain charms for that
	purpose. From the description he gave of the process, it appears to
	be the same as that employed by Dr. Fian and Gellie Duncan to work
	woe upon King James. He stated that the neighbours, instigated by
	a witch, whom he pointed out, took some wax and moulded it before
	the fire into the form of her husband, as near as they could represent
	him; they then pierced the image with pins on all sides, repeated the
	Lord’s Prayer backwards, and offered prayers to the devil that he
	would fix his stings into the person whom that figure represented, in
	like manner as they pierced <em>it</em> with pins. To counteract the effects
	of this diabolical process, the witch-doctor prescribed a certain medicine,
	and a charm to be worn next the body, on that part where the
	disease principally lay. The patient was to repeat the 109th and 119th
	Psalms every day, or the cure would not be effectual. The fee which
	he claimed for this advice was a guinea.</p>

	<p>So efficacious is faith in the cure of any malady, that the patient
	actually felt much better after a three weeks’ course of this prescription.
	The notable charm which the quack had given was afterwards
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"></a>opened, and found to be a piece of parchment covered with some
	cabalistic characters and signs of the planets.</p>

	<p>The next-door neighbours were in great alarm that the witch-doctor
	would, on the solicitation of the recovering patient, employ
	some means to punish them for their pretended witchcraft. To escape
	the infliction, they feed another cunning man, in Nottinghamshire,
	who told them of a similar charm, which would preserve them from
	all the malice of their enemies. The writer concludes by saying, that
	“the doctor, not long after he had been thus consulted, wrote to say,
	that he had discovered that his patient was not afflicted by Satan, as
	he had imagined, but by God, and would continue more or less in the
	same state till his life’s end.”</p>

	<p>An impostor carried on a similar trade in the neighbourhood of
	Tunbridge Wells about the year 1830. He had been in practice for
	several years, and charged enormous fees for his advice. This fellow
	pretended to be the seventh son of a seventh son, and to be endowed
	in consequence with miraculous powers for the cure of all diseases,
	but especially of those resulting from witchcraft. It was not only the
	poor who employed him, but ladies who rode in their carriages. He
	was often sent for from a distance of sixty or seventy miles by these
	people, who paid all his expenses to and fro, besides rewarding him
	handsomely. He was about eighty years of age, and his extremely
	venerable appearance aided his imposition in no slight degree. His
	name was Okey or Oakley.</p>

	<p>In France, the superstition at this day is even more prevalent than
	it is in England. Garinet, in his history of Magic and Sorcery in that
	country, cites upwards of twenty instances which occurred between
	the years 1805 and 1818. In the latter year no less than three tribunals
	were occupied with trials originating in this humiliating belief:
	we shall cite only one of them. Julian Desbourdes, aged fifty-three,
	a mason, and inhabitant of the village of Thilouze, near Bourdeaux,
	was taken suddenly ill, in the month of January 1818. As he
	did not know how to account for his malady, he suspected at last that
	he was bewitched. He communicated this suspicion to his son-in-law
	Bridier, and they both went to consult a sort of idiot, named Baudouin,
	who passed for a conjuror or <em>white-witch</em>. This man told them that
	Desbourdes was certainly bewitched, and offered to accompany them
	to the house of an old man named Renard, who, he said, was undoubtedly
	the criminal. On the night of the 23d of January all three
	proceeded stealthily to the dwelling of Renard, and accused him of
	afflicting persons with diseases by the aid of the devil. Desbourdes
	fell on his knees and earnestly entreated to be restored to his former
	health, promising that he would take no measures against him for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"></a>the evil he had done. The old man denied in the strongest terms
	that he was a wizard; and when Desbourdes still pressed him to remove
	the spell from him, he said he knew nothing about the spell, and
	refused to remove it. The idiot Baudouin, the <em>white-witch</em>, now interfered,
	and told his companions that no relief for the malady could ever
	be procured until the old man confessed his guilt. To force him to
	confession they lighted some sticks of sulphur which they had brought
	with them for the purpose, and placed them under the old man’s nose.
	In a few moments he fell down suffocated and apparently lifeless.
	They were all greatly alarmed; and thinking that they had killed the
	man, they carried him out and threw him into a neighbouring pond,
	hoping to make it appear that he had fallen in accidentally. The
	pond, however, was not very deep, and the coolness of the water reviving
	the old man, he opened his eyes and sat up. Desbourdes and
	Bridier, who were still waiting on the bank, were now more alarmed
	than before, lest he should recover and inform against them. They
	therefore waded into the pond, seized their victim by the hair of the
	head, beat him severely, and then held him under water till he was
	drowned.</p>

	<p>They were all three apprehended on the charge of murder a few
	days afterwards. Desbourdes and Bridier were found guilty of aggravated
	manslaughter only, and sentenced to be burnt on the back, and
	to work in the galleys for life. The <em>white-witch</em> Baudouin was acquitted
	on the ground of insanity.</p>

	<p>M. Garinet further informs us that France, at the time he wrote
	(1818), was overrun by a race of fellows who made a trade of casting
	out devils and finding out witches. He adds also, that many of the
	priests in the rural districts encouraged the superstition of their
	parishioners by resorting frequently to exorcisms whenever any foolish
	persons took it into their heads that a spell had been thrown over
	them. He recommended, as a remedy for the evil, that all these
	exorcists, whether lay or clerical, should be sent to the galleys, and
	felt assured that the number of witches would then very sensibly
	diminish.</p>

	<p>Many other instances of this lingering belief might be cited both
	in France and Great Britain, and indeed in every other country in
	Europe. So deeply rooted are some errors, that ages cannot remove
	them. The poisonous tree that once overshadowed the land may be
	cut down by the sturdy efforts of sages and philosophers; the sun
	may shine clearly upon spots where venomous things once nestled
	in security and shade; but still the entangled roots are stretched beneath
	the surface, and may be found by those who dig. Another
	king like James I. might make them vegetate again; and, more 
	<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"></a>mischievous still, another pope like Innocent VIII. might raise the decaying
	roots to strength and verdure. Still it is consoling to think
	that the delirium has passed away; that the raging madness has given
	place to a milder folly; and that we may now count by units the
	votaries of a superstition which in former ages numbered its victims
	by tens of thousands, and its votaries by millions.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> atrocious system of poisoning by poisons so slow in their operation
	as to make the victim appear, to ordinary observers, as if dying
	from a gradual decay of nature, has been practised in all ages. Those
	who are curious in the matter may refer to Beckmann on secret poisons,
	in his <cite>History of Inventions</cite>, in which he has collected several
	instances of it from the Greek and Roman writers. Early in the
	sixteenth century the crime seems to have gradually increased, till in
	the seventeenth it spread over Europe like a pestilence. It was often
	exercised by pretended witches and sorcerers, and finally became a
	branch of education amongst all who laid any claim to magical and
	supernatural arts. In the twenty-first year of Henry VIII. an act
	was passed rendering it high treason. Those found guilty of it were
	to be boiled to death.</p>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"></a>One of the first in point of date, and hardly second to any in point
	of atrocity, is the murder by this means of Sir Thomas Overbury;
	which disgraced the court of James I. in the year 1613. A slight
	sketch of it will be a fitting introduction to the history of the poisoning
	mania, which was so prevalent in France and Italy fifty years
	later.</p>

	<p>Robert Kerr, a Scottish youth, was early taken notice of by James
	I., and loaded with honours, for no other reason that the world could
	ever discover than the beauty of his person. James, even in his own
	day, was suspected of being addicted to the most abominable of all
	offences; and the more we examine his history now, the stronger the
	suspicion becomes. However that may be, the handsome Kerr, lending
	his smooth cheek even in public to the disgusting kisses of his
	royal master, rose rapidly in favour. In the year 1613, he was made
	Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and created an English peer by the
	style and title of Viscount Rochester. Still further honours were in
	store for him.</p>

	<p>In this rapid promotion he had not been without a friend. Sir
	Thomas Overbury, the king’s secretary—who appears, from some
	threats in his own letters, to have been no better than a pander to the
	vices of the king, and privy to his dangerous secrets—exerted all his
	backstair influence to forward the promotion of Kerr, by whom he
	was doubtless repaid in some way or other. Overbury did not confine
	his friendship to this—if friendship ever could exist between two such
	men—but acted the part of an <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entremetteur</em>, and assisted Rochester to
	carry on an adulterous intrigue with the Lady Frances Howard, the
	wife of the Earl of Essex. This woman was a person of violent passions,
	and lost to all sense of shame. Her husband was in her way,
	and to be freed from him she instituted proceedings for a divorce, on
	grounds which a woman of any modesty or delicacy of feeling would
	die rather than avow. Her scandalous suit was successful, and was
	no sooner decided than preparations on a scale of the greatest magnificence
	were made for her marriage with Lord Rochester.</p>

	<p>Sir Thomas Overbury, who had willingly assisted his patron to
	intrigue with the Countess of Essex, seems to have imagined that his
	marriage with so vile a woman might retard his advancement. He
	accordingly employed all his influence to dissuade him from it; but
	Rochester was bent on the match, and his passions were as violent as
	those of the countess. On one occasion, when Overbury and the
	viscount were walking in the gallery of Whitehall, Overbury was overheard
	to say, “Well, my lord, if you do marry that base woman, you
	will utterly ruin your honour and yourself. You shall never do it
	with my advice or consent; and if you do, you had best look to stand
	<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194"></a>fast.” Rochester flung from him in a rage, exclaiming with an oath,
	“I will be even with you for this.” These words were the death-warrant
	of the unfortunate Overbury. He had mortally wounded the
	pride of Rochester in insinuating that by his (Overbury’s) means he
	might be lowered in the king’s favour; and he had endeavoured to
	curb the burning passions of a heartless, dissolute, and reckless man.</p>

	<p>Overbury’s imprudent remonstrances were reported to the countess;
	and from that moment she also vowed the most deadly vengeance
	against him. With a fiendish hypocrisy, however, they both concealed
	their intentions; and Overbury, at the solicitation of Rochester,
	was appointed ambassador to the court of Russia. This apparent
	favour was but the first step in a deep and deadly plot. Rochester,
	pretending to be warmly attached to the interests of Overbury,
	advised him to refuse the embassy, which he said was but a trick to
	get him out of the way. He promised, at the same time, to stand
	between him and any evil consequences which might result from
	his refusal. Overbury fell into the snare, and declined the embassy.
	James, offended, immediately ordered his committal to the Tower.</p>

	<p>He was now in safe custody, and his enemies had opportunity to
	commence the work of vengeance. The first thing Rochester did was
	to procure, by his influence at court, the dismissal of the Lieutenant
	of the Tower, and the appointment of Sir Jervis Elwes, one of his
	creatures, to the vacant post. This man was but one instrument;
	and another being necessary, was found in Richard Weston, a fellow
	who had formerly been shopman to a druggist. He was installed in
	the office of under-keeper, and as such had the direct custody of
	Overbury. So far all was favourable to the designs of the conspirators.</p>

	<p>In the mean time the insidious Rochester wrote the most friendly
	letters to Overbury, requesting him to bear his ill-fortune patiently,
	and promising that his imprisonment should not be of long duration;
	for that his friends were exerting themselves to soften the king’s displeasure.
	Still pretending the extreme of sympathy for him, he followed
	up the letters by presents of pastry and other delicacies, which
	could not be procured in the Tower. These articles were all poisoned.
	Occasionally, presents of a similar description were sent to
	Sir Jervis Elwes, with the understanding that these articles were not
	poisoned, when they were unaccompanied by letters: of these the
	unfortunate prisoner never tasted. A woman named Turner, who
	had formerly kept a house of ill-fame, and who had more than once
	lent it to further the guilty intercourse of Rochester and Lady Essex,
	was the agent employed to procure the poisons. They were prepared
	by Dr. Forman, a pretended fortune-teller of Lambeth, assisted by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"></a>an apothecary named Franklin. Both these persons knew for what
	purposes the poisons were needed, and employed their skill in mixing
	them in the pastry and other edibles, in such small quantities as
	gradually to wear out the constitution of their victim. Mrs. Turner
	regularly furnished the poisoned articles to the under-keeper, who
	placed them before Overbury. Not only his food but his drink was
	poisoned. Arsenic was mixed with the salt he ate, and cantharides
	with the pepper. All this time his health declined sensibly. Daily he
	grew weaker and weaker; and with a sickly appetite craved for sweets
	and jellies. Rochester continued to condole with him, and anticipated
	all his wants in this respect, sending him abundance of pastry,
	and occasionally partridges and other game, and young pigs. With the
	sauce for the game, Mrs. Turner mixed a quantity of cantharides,
	and poisoned the pork with lunar-caustic. As stated on the trial,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196"></a>Overbury took in this manner poison enough to have poisoned twenty
	men; but his constitution was strong, and he still lingered. Franklin,
	the apothecary, confessed that he prepared with Dr. Forman
	seven different sorts of poisons, viz. aquafortis, arsenic, mercury,
	powder of diamonds, lunar caustic, great spiders, and cantharides.
	Overbury held out so long that Rochester became impatient, and in
	a letter to Lady Essex, expressed his wonder that things were not
	sooner despatched. Orders were immediately sent by Lady Essex to
	the keeper to finish with the victim at once. Overbury had not been
	all this time without suspicion of treachery, although he appears to
	have had no idea of poison. He merely suspected that it was intended
	to confine him for life, and to set the king still more bitterly
	against him. In one of his letters he threatened Rochester that unless
	he were speedily liberated, he would expose his villany to the
	world. He says, “You and I, ere it be long, will come to a public
	trial of another nature.” <span class="keep_together">* * *</span> “Drive me not to extremities,
	lest I should say something that both you and I should repent.”
	<span class="keep_together">* * *</span> “Whether I live or die, your shame shall never
	die, but ever remain to the world, to make you the most odious man
	living.” <span class="keep_together">* * *</span> “I wonder much you should neglect him to
	whom such secrets of all kinds have passed.” <span class="keep_together">* * *</span> “Be these
	the fruits of common secrets, common dangers?”</p>

	</div>	
	
	<p>All these remonstrances, and hints as to the dangerous secrets
	in his keeping, were ill calculated to serve him with a man so reckless
	as Lord Rochester: they were more likely to cause him to be
	sacrificed than to be saved. Rochester appears to have acted as if
	he thought so. He doubtless employed the murderer’s reasoning,
	that “dead men tell no tales,” when, after receiving letters of this
	description, he complained to his paramour of the delay. Weston
	was spurred on to consummate the atrocity; and the patience of all
	parties being exhausted, a dose of corrosive sublimate was administered
	to him in October 1613, which put an end to his sufferings,
	after he had been for six months in their hands. On the very day
	of his death, and before his body was cold, he was wrapped up carelessly
	in a sheet, and buried without any funeral ceremony in a pit
	within the precincts of the Tower.</p>

	<p>Sir Anthony Weldon, in his <cite>Court and Character of James I.</cite>,
	gives a somewhat different account of the closing scene of this tragedy.
	He says, “Franklin and Weston came into Overbury’s chamber,
	and found him in infinite torment, with contention between the
	strength of nature and the working of the poison; and it being very
	like that nature had gotten the better in this contention, by the
	thrusting out of boils, blotches, and blains, they, fearing it might
	<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"></a>come to light by the judgment of physicians, the foul play that had
	been offered him, consented to stifle him with the bedclothes, which
	accordingly was performed; and so ended his miserable life, with the
	assurance of the conspirators that he died by the poison; none thinking
	otherwise than these two murderers.”</p>

	<p>The sudden death, the indecent haste of the funeral, and the
	non-holding of an inquest upon the body, strengthened the suspicions
	that were afloat. Rumour, instead of whispering, began to speak
	out; and the relatives of the deceased openly expressed their belief
	that their kinsman had been murdered. But Rochester was still all
	powerful at court, and no one dared to utter a word to his discredit.
	Shortly afterwards, his marriage with the Countess of Essex was celebrated
	with the utmost splendour, the king himself being present at
	the ceremony.</p>

	<p>It would seem that Overbury’s knowledge of James’s character
	was deeper than Rochester had given him credit for, and that he
	had been a true prophet when he predicted that his marriage would
	eventually estrange James from his minion. At this time, however,
	Rochester stood higher than ever in the royal favour; but it did not
	last long—conscience, that busy monitor, was at work. The tongue
	of rumour was never still; and Rochester, who had long been a
	guilty, became at last a wretched man. His cheeks lost their colour—his
	eyes grew dim; and he became moody, careless, and melancholy.
	The king, seeing him thus, took at length no pleasure in his
	society, and began to look about for another favourite. George Villiers,
	Duke of Buckingham, was the man to his mind: quick-witted,
	handsome, and unscrupulous. The two latter qualities alone were
	sufficient to recommend him to James I. In proportion as the influence
	of Rochester declined, that of Buckingham increased. A
	falling favourite has no friends; and rumour wagged her tongue
	against Rochester louder and more pertinaciously than ever. A new
	favourite, too, generally endeavours to hasten by a kick the fall of
	the old one; and Buckingham, anxious to work the complete ruin
	of his forerunner in the king’s good graces, encouraged the relatives
	of Sir Thomas Overbury to prosecute their inquiries into the strange
	death of their kinsman.</p>

	<p>James was rigorous enough in the punishment of offences when he
	was not himself involved. He piqued himself, moreover, on his dexterity
	in unravelling mysteries. The affair of Sir Thomas Overbury
	found him congenial occupation. He set to work by ordering the
	arrest of Sir Jervis Elwes. James, at this early stage of the proceedings,
	does not seem to have been aware that Rochester was so deeply
	implicated. Struck with horror at the atrocious system of slow poisoning,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"></a>the king sent for all the judges. According to Sir Anthony Weldon,
	he knelt down in the midst of them, and said, “My lords the
	judges, it is lately come to my hearing that you have now in
	examination a business of poisoning. Lord! in what a miserable
	condition shall this
	kingdom be (the only
	famous nation for hospitality
	in the world)
	if our tables should
	become such a snare,
	as that none could
	eat without danger of
	life, and that Italian
	custom should be introduced
	among us!
	Therefore, my lords,
	I charge you, as you
	will answer it at that
	great and dreadful day
	of judgment, that you
	examine it strictly,
	without favour, affection,
	or partiality. And if you shall spare any guilty of this crime,
	God’s curse light on you and your posterity! and if I spare any
	that are guilty, God’s curse light on me and my posterity for
	ever!”</p>

		<p class="caption">DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>The imprecation fell but too surely upon the devoted house of
	Stuart. The solemn oath was broken, and God’s curse <em>did</em> light upon
	him and his posterity!</p>

	<p>The next person arrested after Sir Jervis Elwes, was Weston, the
	under-keeper; then Franklin and Mrs. Turner; and lastly, the Earl
	and Countess of Somerset, to which dignity Rochester had been advanced
	since the death of Overbury.</p>

	<p>Weston was first brought to trial. Public curiosity was on the
	stretch. Nothing else was talked of, and the court on the day of
	trial was crowded to suffocation. The <cite>State Trials</cite> report, that Lord
	Chief Justice Coke “laid open to the jury the baseness and cowardliness
	of poisoners, who attempt that secretly against which there is
	no means of preservation or defence for a man’s life; and how rare
	it was to hear of any poisoning in England, so detestable it was to
	our nation. But the devil had taught divers to be cunning in it, so
	that they can poison in what distance of space they please, by consuming
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">nativum calidum</em>, or <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">humidum radicale</em>, in one month,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199"></a>two or three, or more, as they list, which they four manner of ways
	do execute, viz. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">haustu</em>, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">gustu</em>, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">odore</em>, and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">contactu</em>.”</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>When the indictment was
	read over, Weston made no
	other reply than “Lord have
	mercy upon me! Lord have
	mercy upon me!” On being
	asked how he would be tried,
	he refused to throw himself
	upon a jury of his country,
	and declared that he would be
	tried by God alone. In this
	he persisted for some time.
	The fear of the dreadful punishment
	for contumacy<a href="#fn38" id="fnm38" title="The punishment..." class="fnmarker">38</a> induced
	him at length to plead
	“Not guilty,” and take his
	trial in due course of law.</p>

	<p>All the circumstances against him were fully proved, and he was
	found guilty and executed at Tyburn. Mrs. Turner, Franklin, and
	Sir Jervis Elwes were also brought to trial, found guilty, and executed
	between the 19th of October and the 4th of December 1615;
	but the grand trial of the Earl and Countess of Somerset did not
	take place till the month of May following.</p>

	<p>On the trial of Sir Jervis Elwes, circumstances had transpired,
	shewing a guilty knowledge of the poisoning on the part of the Earl
	of Northampton, the uncle of Lady Somerset, and the chief falconer
	Sir Thomas Monson. The former was dead; but Sir Thomas Monson
	was arrested and brought to trial. It appeared, however, that
	he was too dangerous a man to be brought to the scaffold. He knew
	too many of the odious secrets of James I., and his dying speech
	might contain disclosures which would compromise the king. To conceal
	old guilt it was necessary to incur new: the trial of Sir Thomas
	Monson was brought to an abrupt conclusion, and himself set at liberty.</p>

	<div class="figleft" style="width:117px;"><a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"></a>

		<p class="caption">THE EARL OF SOMERSET.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Already James had broken his oath. He now began to fear that
	he had been rash in engaging so zealously to bring the poisoners to
	punishment. That Somerset would
	be declared guilty there was no doubt,
	and that he looked for pardon and
	impunity was equally evident to the
	king. Somerset, while in the Tower,
	asserted confidently that James would
	not <em>dare</em> to bring him to trial. In
	this he was mistaken; but James
	was in an agony. What the secret
	was between them will now never be
	known with certainty; but it may
	be surmised. Some have imagined
	it to be the vice to which the king
	was addicted; while others have asserted
	that it related to the death
	of Prince Henry, a virtuous young man, who had held Somerset in especial
	abhorrence. This prince died early, unlamented by his father,
	and, as public opinion whispered at the time, poisoned by Somerset.
	Probably some crime or other lay heavy upon the soul of the king;
	and Somerset, his accomplice, could not be brought to public execution
	with safety. Hence the dreadful tortures of James when he discovered
	that his favourite was so deeply implicated in the murder of
	Overbury. Every means was taken by the agonised king to bring the
	prisoner into what was called a safe frame of mind. He was secretly
	advised to plead guilty, and trust to the clemency of the king. The
	same advice was conveyed to the countess. Bacon was instructed by
	the king to draw up a paper of all the points of “mercy and favour”
	to Somerset which might result from the evidence; and Somerset
	was again recommended to plead guilty, and promised that no evil
	should ensue to him.</p>

	<p>The countess was first tried. She trembled and shed tears during
	the reading of the indictment, and, in a low voice, pleaded guilty.
	On being asked why sentence of death should not be passed against
	her, she replied meekly, “I can much aggravate, but nothing extenuate
	my fault. I desire mercy, and that the lords will intercede for
	me with the king.” Sentence of death was passed upon her.</p>

	<p>Next day the earl was brought to trial. He appears to have mistrusted
	the promises of James, and he pleaded not guilty. With a
	self-possession and confidence which he felt, probably, from his knowledge
	of the king’s character, he rigorously cross-examined the witnesses,
	and made a stubborn defence. After a trial which lasted
	<a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201"></a>eleven hours he was found guilty, and condemned to the felon’s
	death.</p>
	
	<div class="figright" style="width:115px;">

		<p class="caption">THE COUNTESS OF SOMERSET.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Whatever may have been the secrets between the criminal and the
	king, the latter, notwithstanding his
	terrific oath, was afraid to sign the
	death-warrant. It might, perchance,
	have been his own. The earl and
	countess were committed to the
	Tower, where they remained for
	nearly five years. At the end of this
	period, to the surprise and scandal
	of the community, and the disgrace
	of its chief magistrate, they both received
	the royal pardon, but were
	ordered to reside at a distance from
	the court. Having been found guilty
	of felony, the estates of the earl had
	become forfeited; but James granted
	him out of their revenues an income of 4000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per annum! Shamelessness
	could go no further.</p>

	<p>Of the after-life of these criminals nothing is known, except that
	the love they had formerly borne each other was changed into aversion,
	and that they lived under the same roof for months together
	without the interchange of a word.</p>

	<p>The exposure of their atrocities did not put a stop to the practice
	of poisoning. On the contrary, as we shall see hereafter, it engendered
	that insane imitation which is so strange a feature of the human
	character. James himself is supposed, with great probability, to have
	fallen a victim to it. In the notes to Harris’s <cite>Life and Writings of
	James I.</cite>, there is a good deal of information on the subject. The
	guilt of Buckingham, although not fully established, rests upon circumstances
	of suspicion stronger than have been sufficient to lead
	hundreds to the scaffold. His motives for committing the crime are
	stated to have been a desire of revenge for the coldness with which
	the king, in the latter years of his reign, began to regard him; his
	fear that James intended to degrade him; and his hope that the
	great influence he possessed over the mind of the heir-apparent would
	last through a new reign, if the old one were brought to a close.</p>

	<p>In the second volume of the <cite>Harleian Miscellany</cite>, there is a tract,
	entitled the <cite>Forerunner of Revenge</cite>, written by George Eglisham,
	doctor of medicine, and one of the physicians to King James. Harris,
	in quoting it, says that it is full of rancour and prejudice. It is evidently
	exaggerated, but forms nevertheless a link in the chain of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202"></a>evidence. Eglisham says, “The king being sick of an ague, the
	duke took this opportunity, when all the king’s doctors of physic
	were at dinner, and offered to him a white powder to take, the which
	he a long time refused; but, overcome with his flattering importunity,
	he took it in wine, and immediately became worse and worse,
	falling into many swoonings and pains, and violent fluxes of the belly,
	so tormented, that his majesty cried out aloud of this white powder,
	‘Would to God I had never taken it!’” He then tells us “of the Countess
	of Buckingham (the duke’s mother) applying the plaister to the
	king’s heart and breast, whereupon he grew faint and short-breathed,
	and in agony; that the physicians exclaimed that the king was poisoned;
	that Buckingham commanded them out of the room, and committed
	one of them close prisoner to his own chamber, and another to
	be removed from court; and that, after his majesty’s death, his body
	and head swelled above measure; his hair, with the skin of his head,
	stuck to his pillow, and his nails became loose on his fingers and
	toes.” Clarendon, who, by the way, was a partisan of the duke’s,
	gives a totally different account of James’s death. He says, “It was
	occasioned by an ague (after a short indisposition by the gout), which,
	meeting many humours in a fat unwieldy body of fifty-eight years
	old, in four or five fits carried him out of the world,—after whose
	death many scandalous and libellous discourses were raised, without
	the least colour or ground, as appeared upon the strictest and most
	malicious examination that could be made, long after, in a time of
	license, when nobody was afraid of offending majesty, and when prosecuting
	the highest reproaches and contumelies against the royal
	family was held very meritorious.” Notwithstanding this confident
	declaration, the world will hardly be persuaded that there was not
	some truth in the rumours that were abroad. The inquiries which
	were instituted were not strict, as he asserts, and all the unconstitutional
	influence of the powerful favourite was exerted to defeat them.
	In the celebrated accusations brought against Buckingham by the
	Earl of Bristol, the poisoning of King James was placed last on the
	list; and the pages of history bear evidence of the summary mode in
	which they were, for the time, got rid of.</p>

	<p>The man from whom Buckingham is said to have procured his
	poisons was one Dr. Lamb, a conjuror and empiric, who, besides dealing
	in poisons, pretended to be a fortune-teller. The popular fury,
	which broke with comparative harmlessness against his patron, was
	directed against this man, until he could not appear with safety in
	the streets of London. His fate was melancholy. Walking one day
	in Cheapside, disguised, as he thought, from all observers, he was
	recognised by some idle boys, who began to hoot and pelt him with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"></a>stones, calling out, “The poisoner! the poisoner! Down with the
	wizard! down with him!” A mob very soon collected, and the
	doctor took to his heels and ran for his life. He was pursued and
	seized in Wood Street, and from thence dragged by the hair through
	the mire to St. Paul’s Cross; the mob beating him with sticks and
	stones, and calling out, “Kill the wizard! kill the poisoner!”</p>

	<p>Charles I., on hearing
	of the riot, rode from
	Whitehall to quell it; but
	he arrived too late to save
	the victim. Every bone
	in his body was broken,
	and he was quite dead.
	Charles was excessively
	indignant, and fined the
	city six hundred pounds
	for its inability to deliver
	up the ring-leaders to
	justice.</p>

	<p>But it was in Italy
	that poisoning was most
	prevalent. From a very
	early period, it seems to
	have been looked upon in
	that country as a perfectly
	justifiable means of
	getting rid of an enemy. The Italians of the sixteenth and seventeenth
	centuries poisoned their opponents with as little compunction
	as an Englishman of the present day brings an action at law against
	any one who has done him an injury. The writings of contemporary
	authors inform us that, when La Spara and La Tophania carried on
	their infernal trade, ladies put poison-bottles on their dressing-tables
	as openly, and used them with as little scruple upon others, as modern
	dames use <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eau de Cologne</em> or lavender-water upon themselves. So
	powerful is the influence of fashion, it can even cause murder to be
	regarded as a venial peccadillo.</p>

	<p>In the memoirs of the last Duke of Guise, who made a Quixotic
	attempt, in 1648, to seize upon the government of Naples, we find
	some curious particulars relative to the popular feeling with regard to
	poisoning. A man named Gennaro Annese, who, after the short and
	extraordinary career of Masaniello the fisherman, had established himself
	as a sort of captain-general of the populace, rendered himself so
	obnoxious to the Duke of Guise, that the adherents of the latter
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"></a>determined to murder him. The captain of the guard, as the duke
	himself very coolly informs us, was requested to undertake this office.
	It was suggested to him that the <em>poniard</em> would be the most effectual
	instrument, but the man turned up his eyes with pious horror at the
	proposition. He was ready to <em>poison</em> Gennaro Annese whenever he
	might be called upon to do so; but to poniard him, he said, would
	be disgraceful, and unbecoming an officer of the guards! At last,
	poison was agreed upon, and Augustino Molla, an attorney in the
	duke’s confidence, brought the bottle containing the liquid to shew
	it to his master. The following is the Duke’s own account:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Augustino came to me at night, and told me: ‘I have brought
		you something which will free you from Gennaro. He deserves death,
		and it is no great matter after what fashion justice is done upon him.
		Look at this vial, full of clear and beautiful water: in four days’ time,
		it will punish all his treasons. The captain of the guard has undertaken
		to give it him; and as it has no taste at all, Gennaro will suspect
		nothing.’”</p>
	</blockquote>	

	<p>The duke further informs us that the dose was duly administered;
	but that Gennaro, fortunately for himself, ate nothing for dinner that
	day but cabbage dressed with oil, which acting as an antidote, caused
	him to vomit profusely, and saved his life. He was exceedingly ill
	for five days, but never suspected that he had been poisoned.</p>

	<p>In process of time, poison-vending became a profitable trade.
	Eleven years after this period, it was carried on at Rome to such an
	extent, that the sluggish government was roused to interference.
	Beckmann, in his <cite>History of Inventions</cite>, and Lebret, in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Magazin
	zum Gebrauche der Staaten Kirche Geschichte</cite>, or <cite>Magazine of Materials
	for a History of a State Church</cite>, relates that, in the year 1659, it was
	made known to Pope Alexander VII. that great numbers of young
	women had avowed in the confessional that they had poisoned their
	husbands with slow poisons. The Catholic clergy, who in general
	hold the secrets of the confessional so sacred, were shocked and
	alarmed at the extraordinary prevalence of the crime. Although they
	refrained from revealing the names of the penitents, they conceived
	themselves bound to apprise the head of the Church of the enormities
	that were practised. It was also the subject of general conversation
	in Rome that young widows were unusually abundant. It was remarked,
	too, that if any couple lived unhappily together, the husband
	soon took ill and died. The papal authorities, when once they began
	to inquire, soon learned that a society of young wives had been formed,
	and met nightly, for some mysterious purpose, at the house of an old
	woman named Hieronyma Spara. This hag was a reputed witch and
	fortune-teller, and acted as president of the young viragos, several of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205"></a>whom, it was afterwards ascertained, belonged to the first families
	of Rome.</p>

	<p>In order to have positive evidence of the practices of this female
	conclave, a lady was employed by the government to seek an interview
	with them. She dressed herself out in the most magnificent
	style; and having been amply provided with money, she found but
	little difficulty, when she had stated her object, of procuring an
	audience of La Spara and her sisterhood. She pretended to be in extreme
	distress of mind on account of the infidelities and ill-treatment
	of her husband, and implored La Spara to furnish her with a few
	drops of the wonderful elixir, the efficacy of which in sending cruel
	husbands to “their last long sleep” was so much vaunted by the
	ladies of Rome. La Spara fell into the snare, and sold her some of
	her “drops” at a price commensurate with the supposed wealth of
	the purchaser.</p>

	<p>The liquor thus obtained was subjected to an analysis, and found
	to be, as was suspected, a slow poison; clear, tasteless, and limpid,
	like that spoken of by the Duke of Guise. Upon this evidence, the
	house was surrounded by the police, and La Spara and her companions
	taken into custody. La Spara, who is described as having been
	a little ugly old woman, was put to the torture, but obstinately
	refused to confess her guilt. Another of the women, named La Gratiosa,
	had less firmness, and laid bare all the secrets of the infernal
	sisterhood. Taking a confession extorted by anguish on the rack at
	its true value (nothing at all), there is still sufficient evidence to warrant
	posterity in the belief of their guilt. They were found guilty,
	and condemned, according to their degrees of culpability, to various
	punishments. La Spara, Gratiosa, and three young women, who had
	poisoned their husbands, were hanged together at Rome. Upwards
	of thirty women were whipped publicly through the streets; and
	several, whose high rank screened them from more degrading punishment,
	were banished from the country, and mulcted in heavy fines.
	In a few months afterwards, nine women more were hanged for
	poisoning; and another bevy, including many young and beautiful
	girls, were whipped half naked through the streets of Rome.</p>

	<p>This severity did not put a stop to the practice, and jealous women
	and avaricious men, anxious to step into the inheritance of fathers,
	uncles, or brothers, resorted to poison. As it was quite free from
	taste, colour, and smell, it was administered without exciting suspicion.
	The skilful vendors compounded it of different degrees of
	strength, so that the poisoners had only to say whether they wanted
	their victims to die in a week, a month, or six months, and they were
	suited with corresponding doses. The vendors were chiefly women,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"></a>of whom the most celebrated was a hag named Tophania, who was
	in this way accessory to the death of upwards of six hundred persons.
	This woman appears to have been a dealer in poisons from her girlhood,
	and resided first at Palermo and then at Naples. That entertaining
	traveller, Father Lebat, has given, in his letters from Italy,
	many curious particulars relating to her. When he was at Civita
	Vecchia, in 1719, the Viceroy of Naples discovered that poison was
	extensively sold in the latter city, and that it went by the name of
	<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">aqueta</em>, or little-water. On making further inquiry, he ascertained
	that Tophania (who was by this time near seventy years of age, and
	who seems to have begun her evil courses very soon after the execution
	of La Spara,) sent large quantities of it to all parts of Italy
	in small vials, with the inscription, “Manna of St. Nicholas of
	Barri.”</p>

	<p>The tomb of St. Nicholas of Barri was celebrated throughout
	Italy. A miraculous oil was said to ooze from it, which cured nearly
	all the maladies that flesh is heir to, provided the recipient made use
	of it with the due degree of <em>faith</em>. La Tophania artfully gave this
	name to her poison to elude the vigilance of the custom-house officers,
	who, in common with every body else, had a pious respect for
	St. Nicholas de Barri and his wonderful oil.</p>

	<p>The poison was similar to that manufactured by La Spara.
	Hahnemann the physician, and father of the homœopathic doctrine,
	writing upon this subject, says it was compounded of arsenical neutral
	salts, occasioning in the victim a gradual loss of appetite, faintness,
	gnawing pains in the stomach, loss of strength, and wasting of
	the lungs. The Abbé Gagliardi says, that a few drops of it were
	generally poured into tea, chocolate, or soup, and its effects were
	slow, and almost imperceptible. Garelli, physician to the Emperor
	of Austria, in a letter to Hoffmann, says it was crystallised arsenic,
	dissolved in a large quantity of water by decoction, with the addition
	(for some unexplained purpose) of the herb <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">cymbalaria</em>. The Neapolitans
	called it <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aqua Toffnina</em>; and it became notorious all over
	Europe under the name of <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aqua Tophania</em>.</p>

	<p>Although this woman carried on her infamous traffic so extensively,
	it was extremely difficult to meet with her. She lived in
	continual dread of discovery. She constantly changed her name and
	residence; and pretending to be a person of great godliness, resided
	in monasteries for months together. Whenever she was more than
	usually apprehensive of detection she sought ecclesiastical protection.
	She was soon apprised of the search made for her by the Viceroy of
	Naples, and, according to her practice, took refuge in a monastery.
	Either the search after her was not very rigid, or her measures were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"></a>exceedingly well taken; for she contrived to elude the vigilance of the
	authorities for several years. What is still more extraordinary, as
	shewing the ramifications of her system, her trade was still carried on
	to as great an extent as before. Lebat informs us that she had so
	great a sympathy for poor wives who hated their husbands and
	wanted to get rid of them, but could not afford to buy her wonderful
	<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">aqua</em>, that she made them presents of it.</p>

	<p>She was not allowed, however, to play at this game for ever; she
	was at length discovered in a nunnery, and her retreat cut off. The
	viceroy made several representations to the superior to deliver her
	up, but without effect. The abbess, supported by the archbishop of
	the diocese, constantly refused. The public curiosity was in consequence
	so much excited at the additional importance thus thrust
	upon the criminal, that thousands of persons visited the nunnery in
	order to catch a glimpse of her.</p>

	<p>The patience of the viceroy appears to have been exhausted by
	these delays. Being a man of sense, and not a very zealous Catholic,
	he determined that even the Church should not shield a criminal so
	atrocious. Setting the privileges of the nunnery at defiance, he sent
	a troop of soldiers, who broke over the walls, and carried her away <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi
	et armis</em>. The archbishop, Cardinal Pignatelli, was highly indignant,
	and threatened to excommunicate and lay the whole city under interdict.
	All the inferior clergy, animated by the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit du corps</em>, took
	up the question, and so worked upon the superstitious and bigoted
	people, that they were ready to rise in a mass to storm the palace of
	the viceroy and rescue the prisoner.</p>

	<p>These were serious difficulties; but the viceroy was not a man to
	be daunted. Indeed, he seems to have acted throughout with a rare
	union of astuteness, coolness, and energy. To avoid the evil consequences
	of the threatened excommunication, he placed a guard round
	the palace of the archbishop, judging that the latter would not
	be so foolish as to launch out an anathema which would cause
	the city to be starved, and himself in it. The market-people
	would not have dared to come to the city with provisions so long as
	it remained under the ban. There would have been too much inconvenience
	to himself and his ghostly brethren in such a measure; and,
	as the viceroy anticipated, the good cardinal reserved his thunders
	for some other occasion.</p>

	<p>Still there was the populace. To quiet their clamour and avert
	the impending insurrection, the agents of the government adroitly
	mingled with the people, and spread abroad a report that Tophania
	had poisoned all the wells and fountains of the city. This was enough.
	The popular feeling was turned against her immediately. Those who,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"></a>but a moment before, had looked upon her as a saint, now reviled
	her as a devil, and were as eager for her punishment as they had before
	been for her escape. Tophania was then put to the torture.
	She confessed the long catalogue of her crimes, and named all the
	persons who had employed her. She was shortly afterwards strangled,
	and her corpse thrown over the wall into the garden of the convent
	from whence she had been taken. This appears to have been done to
	conciliate the clergy, by allowing them, at least, the burial of one
	who had taken refuge within their precincts.</p>

	<p>After her death the mania for poisoning seems to have abated;
	but we have yet to see what hold it took upon the French people at
	a somewhat earlier period. So rooted had it become in France between
	the years 1670 and 1680, that Madame de Sevigné, in one of
	her letters, expresses her fear that Frenchman and poisoner would
	become synonymous terms.</p>

	<p>As in Italy, the first notice the government received of the prevalence
	of this crime was given by the clergy, to whom females of high
	rank, and some among the middle and lower classes, had avowed in
	the confessional that they had poisoned their husbands. In consequence
	of these disclosures, two Italians, named Exili and Glaser,
	were arrested, and thrown into the Bastille, on the charge of compounding
	and selling the drugs used for these murders. Glaser died
	in prison, but Exili remained without trial for several months; and
	there, shortly afterwards, he made the acquaintance of another prisoner,
	named Sainte Croix, by whose example the crime was still further
	disseminated among the French people.</p>

	<p>The most notorious of the poisoners that derived their pernicious
	knowledge from this man was Madame de Brinvilliers, a young
	woman connected both by birth and marriage with some of the noblest
	families of France. She seems, from her very earliest years, to have
	been heartless and depraved; and, if we may believe her own confession,
	was steeped in wickedness ere she had well entered her teens.
	She was, however, beautiful and accomplished; and, in the eye of
	the world, seemed exemplary and kind. Guyot de Pitaval, in the
	<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Causes Célèbres</cite>, and Madame de Sevigné, in her letters, represent her
	as mild and agreeable in her manners, and offering no traces on her
	countenance of the evil soul within. She was married in 1651 to the
	Marquis de Brinvilliers, with whom she lived unhappily for some
	years. He was a loose, dissipated character, and was the means of
	introducing Sainte Croix to his wife, a man who cast a blight upon
	her life, and dragged her on from crime to crime, till her offences
	became so great that the mind shudders to dwell upon them. For
	this man she conceived a guilty passion, to gratify which she plunged
	<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"></a>at once into the gulf of sin. She was drawn to its most loathsome
	depths ere retribution overtook her.</p>

	<p>She had as yet shewn a fair outside to the world, and found but
	little difficulty in effecting a legal separation from her husband, who
	had not the art to conceal his vices. The proceeding gave great
	offence to her family. She appears, after this, to have thrown off the
	mask completely, and carried on her intrigues so openly with her
	lover, Sainte Croix, that her father, M. D’Aubray, scandalised at her
	conduct, procured a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</em>, and had him imprisoned in the
	Bastille for a twelvemonth.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>Sainte Croix, who had been in Italy, was a dabbler in poisons.
	He knew something of the secrets of the detestable La Spara, and
	improved himself in them from the instructions of Exili, with whom
	he speedily contracted a sort of friendship. By him he was shewn
	how to prepare, not only the liquid poisons employed in Italy, but
	that known as <em>succession powder</em>, which afterwards became so celebrated
	in France. Like his mistress, he appeared amiable, witty, and
	intelligent, and shewed no signs to the world of the two fierce
	<a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210"></a>passions, revenge and avarice, which were gnawing at his heart. Both
	these passions were to be sated on the unfortunate family of D’Aubray;
	his revenge, because they had imprisoned him; and his avarice, because
	they were rich. Reckless and extravagant, he was always in
	want of money, and he had no one to supply him but Madame de
	Brinvilliers, whose own portion was far from sufficient to satisfy his
	need. Groaning to think that any impediment should stand between
	him and wealth, he conceived the horrid idea of poisoning M. D’Aubray
	her father, and her two brothers, that she might inherit the property.
	Three murders were nothing to such a villain. He communicated
	his plan to Madame de Brinvilliers; and she, without the slightest
	scruple, agreed to aid him: he undertook to compound the poisons,
	and she to administer them. The zeal and alacrity with which she
	set to work seem hardly credible. Sainte Croix found her an apt
	scholar; and she soon became as expert as himself in the manufacture
	of poisons. To try the strength of the first doses, she used to administer
	them to dogs, rabbits, and pigeons. Afterwards, wishing to
	be more certain of their effects, she went round to the hospitals, and
	administered them to the sick poor in the soups which she brought
	in apparent charity.<a href="#fn39" id="fnm39" title="This is denied by Voltaire..." class="fnmarker">39</a> None of the poisons were intended to kill at
	the first dose; so that she could try them once upon an individual
	without fear of murder. She tried the same atrocious experiment
	upon the guests at her father’s table, by poisoning a pigeon-pie! To
	be more certain still, she next poisoned herself! When convinced by
	this desperate essay of the potency of the draught, she procured an
	antidote from Sainte Croix, and all doubts being removed, commenced
	operations upon her grey-headed father. She administered the first
	dose with her own hands, in his chocolate. The poison worked well.
	The old man was taken ill, and his daughter, apparently full of tenderness
	and anxiety, watched by his bedside. The next day she gave
	him some broth, which she recommended as highly nourishing. This
	also was poisoned. In this manner she gradually wore out his frame,
	and in less than ten days he was a corpse! His death seemed so much
	the result of disease, that no suspicions were excited.</p>
	
	<p>When the two brothers arrived from the provinces to render the
	last sad duties to their sire, they found their sister as grieved, to all
	outward appearance, as even filial affection could desire: but the
	young men only came to perish. They stood between Sainte Croix
	and the already half-clutched gold, and their doom was sealed. A
	man, named La Chaussée, was hired by Sainte Croix to aid in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"></a>administering the poisons; and, in less than six weeks time, they had
	both gone to their long home.</p>

	<p>Suspicion was now excited; but so cautiously had all been done,
	that it found no one upon whom to attach itself. The marquise had
	a sister, and she was entitled, by the death of her relatives, to half
	the property. Less than the whole would not satisfy Sainte Croix,
	and he determined that she should die the same death as her father
	and brothers. She was too distrustful, however; and, by quitting
	Paris, she escaped the destruction that was lurking for her.</p>

	<p>The marquise had undertaken these murders to please her lover.
	She was now anxious to perpetrate another on her own account. She
	wished to marry Sainte Croix; but, though separated from her husband,
	she was not divorced. She thought it would be easier to poison
	him than to apply to the tribunals for a divorce, which might, perhaps,
	be refused. But Sainte Croix had no longer any love for his guilty
	instrument. Bad men do not admire others who are as bad as themselves.
	Though a villain himself, he had no desire to marry one,
	and was not at all anxious for the death of the marquis. He seemed,
	however, to enter into the plot, and supplied her with poison for her
	husband; but he took care to provide a remedy. La Brinvilliers
	poisoned him one day, and Sainte Croix gave him an antidote the
	next. In this manner he was buffeted about between them for some
	time, and finally escaped, with a ruined constitution and a broken heart.</p>

	<p>But the day of retribution was at hand, and a terrible mischance
	brought the murders to light. The nature of the poisons compounded
	by Sainte Croix was so deadly, that, when working in his laboratory,
	he was obliged to wear a mask, to preserve himself from suffocation.
	One day, the mask slipped off, and the miserable wretch perished in
	his crimes. His corpse was found, on the following morning, in the
	obscure lodging where he had fitted up his laboratory. As he appeared
	to be without friends or relatives, the police took possession of his
	effects. Among other things, was found a small box, to which was
	affixed the following singular document:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“I humbly beg, that those into whose hands this box may fall,
		will do me the favour to deliver it into the hands only of the Marchioness
		de Brinvilliers, who resides in the Rue Neuve St. Paul, as
		every thing it contains concerns her, and belongs to her alone; and
		as, besides, there is nothing in it that can be of use to any person but
		her. In case she shall be dead before me, it is my wish that it be
		burned, with every thing it contains, without opening or altering
		any thing. In order that no one may plead ignorance, I swear by
		the God that I adore, and by all that is held most sacred, that I assert
		nothing but the truth: and if my intentions, just and reasonable as
		<a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"></a>they are, be thwarted in this point by any persons, I charge their consciences
		with it, both in this world and that which is to come, in
		order that I may unload mine. I protest that this is my last will.
		Done at Paris, May 25, 1672. <span style="padding-left:2em;">(Signed)</span> <span class="special_name">Sainte Croix</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This earnest solicitation, instead of insuring respect, as was intended,
	excited curiosity. The box was opened, and found to contain
	some papers, and several vials and powders. The latter were handed
	to a chemist for analysis, and the documents were retained by the
	police, and opened. Among them was found a promissory note of the
	Marchioness de Brinvilliers, for thirty thousand francs, to the order
	of Sainte Croix. The other papers were of greater importance, as
	they implicated both her and her servant, La Chaussée, in the recent
	murders. As soon as she was informed of the death of Sainte Croix,
	she made an attempt to gain possession of his papers and the box;
	but, being refused, she saw that there was no time to be lost, and
	immediately quitted. Next morning the police were on her trail;
	but she succeeded in escaping to England. La Chaussée was not so
	fortunate. Altogether ignorant of the fatal mischance which had
	brought his villanies to light, he did not dream of danger. He was
	arrested and brought to trial: being put to the torture, he confessed
	that he had administered poison to the Messieurs d’Aubray, and that
	he had received a hundred pistoles, and the promise of an annuity for
	life, from Sainte Croix and Madame de Brinvilliers, for the job. He
	was condemned to be broken alive on the wheel, and the marchioness
	was, by default, sentenced to be beheaded. He was executed accordingly,
	in March 1673, on the Place de Grève, in Paris.</p>

	<p>La Brinvilliers appears to have resided for nearly three years in
	England. Early in 1676, thinking that the rigour of pursuit was over,
	and that she might venture to return to the Continent, she proceeded
	secretly to Liège. Notwithstanding her care, the French authorities
	were soon apprised of her return; and arrangements were promptly
	made with the municipality of that city to permit the agents of the
	French police to arrest her within the limits of their jurisdiction.
	Desgrais, an officer of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maréchaussée</em>, accordingly left Paris for that
	purpose. On his arrival in Liège, he found that she had sought shelter
	within the walls of a convent. Here the arm of the law, long as
	it is said to be, could not reach her: but Desgrais was not a man to
	be baffled, and he resorted to stratagem to accomplish what force
	could not. Having disguised himself as a priest, he sought admission
	to the convent, and obtained an interview with La Brinvilliers. He
	said, that being a Frenchman, and passing through Liège, he could
	not leave that city without paying a visit to a lady whose beauty and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"></a>misfortunes were so celebrated. Her vanity was flattered by the compliment.
	Desgrais saw, to use a vulgar but forcible expression, “that
	he had got on the blind side of her;” and he adroitly continued to
	pour out the language of love and admiration till the deluded marchioness
	was thrown completely off her guard. She agreed, without
	much solicitation, to meet him outside the walls of the convent,
	where their amorous intrigue might be carried on more conveniently
	than within. Faithful to her appointment with her supposed new
	lover, she came, and found herself, not in the embrace of a gallant,
	but in the custody of a policeman.</p>

	<p>Her trial was not long delayed. The proofs against her were
	abundant. The dying declaration of La Chaussée would have been
	alone enough to convict her; but besides that, there were the mysterious
	document attached to the box of St. Croix, her flight from
	France, and, stronger and more damning proof than all, a paper, in
	her own handwriting, found among the effects of St. Croix, in which
	she detailed to him the misdeeds of her life, and spoke of the murder
	of her father and brothers in terms that left no doubt of her guilt.
	During the trial, all Paris was in commotion. La Brinvilliers was the
	only subject of conversation. All the details of her crimes were published,
	and greedily devoured; and the idea of secret poisoning first
	put into the heads of hundreds, who afterwards became guilty of it.</p>

	<p>On the 16th of July, 1676, the Superior Criminal Court of Paris
	pronounced a verdict of guilty against her, for the murder of her father
	and brothers, and the attempt upon the life of her sister. She
	was condemned to be drawn on a hurdle, with her feet bare, a rope
	about her neck, and a burning torch in her hand, to the great entrance
	of the cathedral of Notre Dame, where she was to make the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende
	honorable</em> in sight of all the people; to be taken from thence to the
	Place de Grève, and there to be beheaded. Her body was afterwards
	to be burned, and her ashes scattered to the winds.</p>

	<p>After her sentence, she made a full confession of her guilt. She seems
	to have looked upon death without fear; but it was recklessness, not
	courage, that supported her. Madame de Sevigné says, that when on
	the hurdle, on her way to the scaffold, she entreated her confessor to
	exert his influence with the executioner to place himself next to her,
	that his body might hide from her view “that scoundrel Desgrais,
	who had entrapped her.” She also asked the ladies, who had been
	drawn to their windows to witness the procession, what they were
	looking at? adding, “a pretty sight you have come to see, truly!”
	She laughed when on the scaffold, dying as she had lived, impenitent
	and heartless. On the morrow, the populace came in crowds to collect
	her ashes to preserve them as relics. She was regarded as a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"></a>martyred saint, and her ashes were supposed to be endowed, by divine
	grace, with the power of curing all diseases. Popular folly has often
	canonised persons whose pretensions to sanctity were extremely equivocal;
	but the disgusting folly of the multitude, in this instance, has
	never been surpassed.</p>

	<p>Before her death, proceedings were instituted against M. de Penautier,
	treasurer of the province of Languedoc, and receiver-general
	for the clergy, who was accused by a lady, named St. Laurent, of having
	poisoned her husband, the late receiver-general, in order to obtain
	his appointment. The circumstances of this case were never divulged,
	and the greatest influence was exerted to prevent it from going to
	trial. He was known to have been intimate with Sainte Croix and
	Madame de Brinvilliers, and was thought to have procured his poisons
	from them. The latter, however, refused to say any thing which
	might implicate him. The inquiry was eventually stifled, after Penautier
	had been several months in the Bastille.</p>

	<p>The Cardinal de Bonzy was accused by the gossips of the day of
	being an accomplice of Penautier. The cardinal’s estates were burdened
	with the payment of several heavy annuities; but, about the
	time that poisoning became so fashionable, all the annuitants died off,
	one after the other. The cardinal, in talking of these annuitants,
	afterwards used to say, “Thanks to my star, I have outlived them
	all!” A wit, seeing him and Penautier riding in the same carriage,
	cried out, in allusion to this expression, “There go the Cardinal de
	Bonzy and his <em>star</em>!”</p>

	<p>It was now that the mania for poisoning began to take hold of the
	popular mind. From this time until the year 1682, the prisons of
	France teemed with persons accused of this crime; and it is very
	singular that other offences decreased in a similar proportion. We
	have already seen the extent to which it was carried in Italy. It was,
	if possible, surpassed in France. The diabolical ease with which these
	murders could be effected, by means of these scentless and tasteless
	poisons, enticed the evil-minded. Jealousy, revenge, avarice, even
	petty spite, alike resorted to them. Those who would have been deterred,
	by fear of detection, from using the pistol or the dagger, or
	even strong doses of poison, which kill at once, employed slow poisons
	without dread. The corrupt government of the day, although it
	could wink at the atrocities of a wealthy and influential courtier like
	Penautier, was scandalised to see the crime spreading among the
	people. Disgrace was, in fact, entailed, in the eyes of Europe, upon
	the name of Frenchman. Louis XIV., to put a stop to the evil, instituted
	what was called the Chambre Ardente, or Burning Chamber,
	with extensive powers for the trial and punishment of the prisoners.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215"></a>Two women, especially, made themselves notorious at this time,
	and were instrumental to the deaths of hundreds of individuals. They
	both resided in Paris, and were named Lavoisin and Lavigoreux.
	Like Spara and Tophania, of whom they were imitators, they chiefly
	sold their poisons to women who wanted to get rid of their husbands;
	and, in some few instances, to husbands who wanted to get rid of
	their wives. Their ostensible occupation was that of midwives. They
	also pretended to be fortune-tellers, and were visited by persons of
	every class of society. The rich and poor thronged alike to their
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mansardes</em> to learn the secrets of the future. Their prophecies were
	principally of death. They foretold to women the approaching dissolution
	of husbands, and to needy heirs the end of rich relatives,
	who had made them, as Byron expresses it, “wait too, too long
	already.” They generally took care to be instrumental in fulfilling
	their own predictions. They used to tell their wretched employers
	that some sign of the approaching death would take place in the house,
	such as the breaking of glass or china; and they paid servants considerable
	fees to cause a breakage, as if by accident, exactly at the appointed
	time. Their occupation as midwives made them acquainted
	with the secrets of many families, which they afterwards turned to
	dreadful account.</p>

	<p>It is not known how long they had carried on this awful trade
	before they were discovered. Detection finally overtook them at the
	close of the year 1679. They were both tried, found guilty, and
	burned alive on the Place de Grève, on the 22d of February, 1680,
	after their hands had been bored through with a red-hot iron, and
	then cut off. Their numerous accomplices in Paris and in the provinces
	were also discovered and brought to trial. According to some
	authors, thirty, and to others, fifty of them, chiefly women, were
	hanged in the principal cities.</p>

	<p>Lavoisin kept a list of the visitors who came to her house to purchase
	poisons. This paper was seized by the police on her arrest, and
	examined by the tribunals. Among the names were found those of
	the Marshal de Luxembourg, the Countess de Soissons, and the
	Duchess de Bouillon. The marshal seems only to have been guilty
	of a piece of discreditable folly in visiting a woman of this description,
	but the popular voice at the time imputed to him something
	more than folly. The author of the <cite>Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe
	since the Peace of Utrecht</cite>, says, “The miserable gang who dealt in
	poison and prophecy alleged that he had sold himself to the devil,
	and that a young girl of the name of Dupin had been poisoned by his
	means. Among other stories, they said he had made a contract with
	the devil, in order to marry his son to the daughter of the Marquis
	<a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216"></a>of Louvois. To this atrocious and absurd accusation the marshal,
	who had surrendered himself at the Bastille on the first accusation
	against him, replied with the mingled sentiment of pride and innocence,
	‘When Mathieu de Montmorenci, my ancestor, married the
	widow of Louis le Gros, he did not have recourse to the devil, but to
	the states-general, in order to obtain for the minor king the support
	of the house of Montmorenci.’ This brave man was imprisoned in a
	cell six feet and a half long, and his trial, which was interrupted
	for several weeks, lasted altogether fourteen months. No judgment
	was pronounced upon him.”</p>

	<p>The Countess of Soissons fled to Brussels, rather than undergo the
	risk of a trial; and was never able to clear herself from the stigma
	that attached to her, of having made an attempt to poison the Queen
	of Spain by doses of succession-powder. The Duchess of Bouillon
	was arrested, and tried by the Chambre Ardente. It would appear,
	however, that she had nothing to do with the slow poisons, but had
	merely endeavoured to pry into the secrets of futurity, and gratify
	her curiosity with a sight of the devil. One of the presidents of the
	Chambre, La Reynie, an ugly little old man, very seriously asked her
	whether she had really seen the devil; to which the lady replied,
	looking him full in the face, “Oh, yes! I see him now. He is in the
	form of a little ugly old man, exceedingly illnatured, and is dressed
	in the robes of a Counsellor of State.” M. la Reynie prudently refrained
	from asking any more questions of a lady with so sharp and
	ready a tongue. The duchess was imprisoned for several months in
	the Bastille; and nothing being proved against her, she was released
	at the intercession of her powerful friends. The severe punishment
	of criminals of this note might have helped to abate the fever of imitation
	among the vulgar;—their comparative impunity had a contrary
	tendency. The escape of Penautier, and the wealthy Cardinal
	de Bonzy his employer, had the most pernicious effect. For two years
	longer the crime continued to rage, and was not finally suppressed
	till the stake had blazed, or the noose dangled, for upwards of a hundred
	individuals.<a href="#fn40" id="fnm40" title="Slow poisoning is a crime..." class="fnmarker">40</a></p>

		<p>Here’s a knocking indeed!… Knock! knock! knock!…
		Who’s there, i’ the name o’ Beelzebub?… Who’s there, i’ the devil’s
		name? Knock! knock! knock!—Never at quiet?—<cite>Macbeth</cite>.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Who</span> has not either seen or heard of some house, shut up and uninhabitable,
	fallen into decay, and looking dusty and dreary, from
	which, at midnight, strange sounds have been heard to issue—aerial
	knockings—the rattling of chains, and the groaning of perturbed spirits?—a
	house that people have thought it unsafe to pass after dark,
	and which has remained for years without a tenant, and which no
	tenant would occupy, even were he paid to do so? There are hundreds
	of such houses in England at the present day; hundreds in
	France, Germany, and almost every country of Europe, which are
	marked with the mark of fear—places for the timid to avoid, and the
	pious to bless themselves at, and ask protection from, as they pass—the
	abodes of ghosts and evil spirits. There are many such houses in
	London; and if any vain boaster of the march of intellect would but
	take the trouble to find them out and count them, he would be convinced
	that intellect must yet make some enormous strides before
	such old superstitions can be eradicated.</p>

	<p>The idea that such houses exist is a remnant of the witch creed,
	which merits separate notice from its comparative harmlessness, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218"></a>from its being not so much a madness as a folly of the people. Unlike
	other notions that sprang from the belief in witchcraft, and
	which we have already dwelt upon at sufficient length, it has sent no
	wretches to the stake or the gibbet, and but a few to the pillory only.</p>

	<p>Many houses have been condemned as haunted, and avoided by
	the weak and credulous, from circumstances the most trifling in
	themselves, and which only wanted a vigorous mind to clear up, at
	once, and dissipate all alarm. A house in Aix-la-Chapelle, a large
	desolate-looking building, remained uninhabited for five years, on
	account of the mysterious knockings that there were heard within it
	at all hours of the day and night. Nobody could account for the
	noises; and the fear became at last so excessive, that the persons
	who inhabited the houses on either side relinquished their tenancy,
	and went to reside in other quarters of the town, where there was
	less chance of interruption from evil spirits. From being so long
	without an inhabitant, the house at last grew so ruinous, so dingy,
	and so miserable in its outward appearance, and so like the place
	that ghosts might be supposed to haunt, that few persons cared to
	go past it after sunset. The knocking that was heard in one of the
	upper rooms was not very loud, but it was very regular. The gossips
	of the neighbourhood asserted that they often heard groans from the
	cellars, and saw lights moved about from one window to another
	immediately after the midnight bell had tolled. Spectres in white
	habiliments were reported to have gibed and chattered from the windows;
	but all these stories could bear no investigation. The knocking,
	however, was a fact which no one could dispute, and several ineffectual
	attempts were made by the proprietor to discover the cause.
	The rooms were sprinkled with holy water; the evil spirits were commanded
	in due form, by a priest, to depart thence to the Red Sea;
	but the knockings still continued, in spite of all that could be done
	in that way. Accident at last discovered the cause, and restored
	tranquillity to the neighbourhood. The proprietor, who suffered not
	only in his mind but in his pocket, had sold the building at a ruinously
	small price, to get rid of all future annoyance. The new proprietor
	was standing in a room on the first floor when he heard the
	door driven to at the bottom with a considerable noise, and then fly
	open immediately, about two inches and no more. He stood still
	a minute and watched, and the same thing occurred a second and a
	third time. He examined the door attentively, and all the mystery
	was unravelled. The latch of the door was broken, so that it could
	not be fastened, and it swung chiefly upon the bottom hinge. Immediately
	opposite was a window, in which one pane of glass was
	broken; and when the wind was in a certain quarter, the draught of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219"></a>air was so strong that it blew the door to with some violence. There
	being no latch, it swung open again; and when there was a fresh
	gust, was again blown to. The new proprietor lost no time in sending
	for a glazier, and the mysterious noises ceased for ever. The
	house was replastered and repainted, and once more regained its lost
	good name. It was not before two or three years, however, that it
	was thoroughly established in popular favour; and many persons,
	even then, would always avoid passing it, if they could reach their
	destination by any other street.</p>

	<p>A similar story is narrated by Sir Walter Scott, in his <cite>Letters on
	Demonology and Witchcraft</cite>, the hero of which was a gentleman of
	birth and distinction, well known in the political world. Shortly
	after he succeeded to his title and estates, there was a rumour among
	the servants concerning a strange noise that used to be heard at night
	in the family mansion, and the cause of which no one could ascertain.
	The gentleman resolved to discover it himself, and to watch
	for that purpose with a domestic who had grown old in the family,
	and who, like the rest, had whispered strange things about the
	knocking having begun immediately upon the death of his old master.
	These two watched until the noise was heard, and at last traced
	it to a small store-room, used as a place for keeping provisions of
	various kinds for the family, and of which the old butler had the
	key. They entered this place, and remained for some time without
	hearing the noises which they had traced thither. At length the
	sound was heard, but much lower than it seemed to be while they
	were farther off, and their imaginations were more excited. They
	then discovered the cause without difficulty. A rat, caught in an
	old-fashioned trap, had occasioned the noise by its efforts to escape,
	in which it was able to raise the trap-door of its prison to a certain
	height, but was then obliged to drop it. The noise of the fall resounding
	through the house had occasioned the mysterious rumours,
	which, but for the investigation of the proprietor, would, in all probability,
	have acquired so bad a name for the dwelling that no servants
	would have inhabited it. The circumstance was told to Sir
	Walter Scott by the gentleman to whom it happened.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>But, in general, houses that have acquired this character have
	been more indebted for it to the roguery of living men than to accidents
	like these. Six monks played off a clever trick of the kind
	upon that worthy king, Louis, whose piety has procured him in the
	annals of his own country the designation of “the Saint.” Having
	heard his confessor speak in terms of warm eulogy of the goodness
	and learning of the monks of the order of St. Bruno, he expressed
	his wish to establish a community of them near Paris. Bernard de
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"></a>la Tour, the superior, sent six of the brethren, and the king gave
	them a handsome house to live in in the village of Chantilly. It so
	happened that from their windows they had a very fine view of the
	ancient palace of Vauvert, which had been built for a royal residence
	by King Robert, but deserted for many years.
	The worthy monks thought the palace would
	just suit them; but their modesty was so
	excessive that they were ashamed to ask the
	king for a grant of it in due form. This
	difficulty was not to be overcome, and the
	monks set their ingenuity to work to discover
	another plan. The palace of Vauvert
	had never laboured under any imputation
	upon its character until they became its
	neighbours; but, somehow or other, it almost
	immediately afterwards began to acquire
	a bad name. Frightful shrieks were
	heard to proceed from it at night; blue,
	red, and green lights were suddenly seen to
	glimmer from the windows, and as suddenly
	to disappear; the clanking of chains was
	heard, and the howling as of persons in
	great pain. These disturbances continued for
	several months, to the great terror of all the
	country round, and even of the pious King
	Louis, to whom, at Paris, all the rumours
	were regularly carried with whole heaps of
	additions that accumulated on the way. At
	last a great spectre, clothed all in pea-green,
	with a long white beard and a serpent’s tail,
	took his station regularly at midnight in
	the principal window of the palace, and
	howled fearfully, and shook his fists at the passengers. The six
	monks at Chantilly, to whom all these things were duly narrated,
	were exceedingly wrath that the devil should play such antics right
	opposite their dwelling, and hinted to the commissioners sent down
	by Saint Louis to investigate the matter, that if they were allowed
	to inhabit the palace, they would very soon make a clearance of
	the evil spirits. The king was quite charmed with their piety, and
	expressed to them how grateful he felt for their disinterestedness.
	A deed was forthwith drawn up, the royal sign-manual was affixed
	to it, and the palace of Vauvert became the property of the monks
	of St. Bruno. The deed is dated 1259. The disturbances ceased
	<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"></a>immediately, the lights disappeared, and the green ghost (so said the
	monks) was laid at rest for ever under the waves of the Red Sea.<a href="#fn41" id="fnm41" title="Garinet..." class="fnmarker">41</a></p>
	
	<p>In the year 1580, one Gilles Blacre had taken the lease of a house
	in the suburbs of Tours, but repenting him of his bargain with the
	landlord, Peter Piquet, he endeavoured to prevail upon him to cancel
	the agreement. Peter, however, was satisfied with his tenant
	and his terms, and would listen to no compromise. Very shortly
	afterwards, the rumour was spread all over Tours that the house of
	Gilles Blacre was haunted. Gilles himself asserted that he verily
	believed his house to be the general rendezvous of all the witches and
	evil spirits of France. The noise they made was awful, and quite
	prevented him from sleeping. They knocked against the wall, howled
	in the chimneys, broke his window-glass, scattered his pots and pans
	all over his kitchen, and set his chairs and tables a dancing the whole
	night through. Crowds of persons assembled round the house to hear
	the mysterious noises: and the bricks were observed to detach themselves
	from the wall, and fall into the streets upon the heads of those
	who had not said their paternoster before coming out in the morning.
	These things having continued for some time, Gilles Blacre made his
	complaint to the Civil Court of Tours, and Peter Piquet was summoned
	to shew cause why the lease should not be annulled. Poor
	Peter could make no defence, and the court unanimously agreed that
	no lease could hold good under such circumstances, and annulled it
	accordingly, condemning the unlucky owner to all the expenses of
	the suit. Peter appealed to the parliament of Paris; and after a
	long examination, the parliament confirmed the lease. “Not,” said
	the judge, “because it has not been fully and satisfactorily proved
	that the house is troubled by evil spirits, but that there was an informality
	in the proceedings before the Civil Court of Tours, that
	rendered its decision null and of no effect.”</p>

	<p>A similar cause was tried before the Parliament of Bourdeaux, in
	the year 1595, relative to a house in that city which was sorely troubled
	by evil spirits. The parliament appointed certain ecclesiastics
	to examine and report to them, and on their report in the affirmative
	that the house was haunted, the lease was annulled, and the tenant
	absolved from all payment of rent and taxes.<a href="#fn42" id="fnm42" title="Ibid. p. 156." class="fnmarker">42</a></p>

	<p>One of the best stories of a haunted house is that of the royal
	palace of Woodstock, in the year 1649, when the commissioners sent
	from London by the Long Parliament to take possession of it, and
	efface all the emblems of royalty about it, were fairly driven out by
	their fear of the devil, and the annoyances they suffered from a
	roguish cavalier, who played the imp to admiration. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222"></a>commissioners, dreading at that time no devil, arrived at Woodstock on
	the 13th of October, 1649. They took up their lodgings in the late
	king’s apartments—turned the beautiful bedrooms and withdrawing-rooms
	into kitchens and sculleries—the council-hall into a brew-house,
	and made the dining-room a place to keep firewood in. They
	pulled down all the insignia of royal state, and treated with the utmost
	indignity every thing that recalled to their memory the name
	or the majesty of Charles Stuart. One Giles Sharp accompanied them
	in the capacity of clerk, and seconded their efforts, apparently with
	the greatest zeal. He aided them to uproot a noble old tree, merely
	because it was called the <em>King’s</em> Oak, and tossed the fragments into
	the dining-room to make cheerful fires for the commissioners. During
	the first two days, they heard some strange noises about the house,
	but they paid no great attention to them. On the third, however,
	they began to suspect they had got into bad company; for they heard,
	as they thought, a supernatural dog under their bed, which gnawed
	their bed-clothes. On the next day, the chairs and tables began to
	dance, apparently of their own accord. On the fifth day, something
	came into the bedchamber and walked up and down; and fetching
	the warming-pan out of the withdrawing-room, made so much noise
	with it that they thought five church-bells were ringing in their ears.
	On the sixth day, the plates and dishes were thrown up and down
	the dining-room. On the seventh, they penetrated into the bedroom
	in company with several logs of wood, and usurped the soft pillows
	intended for the commissioners. On the eighth and ninth nights,
	there was a cessation of hostilities; but on the tenth, the bricks in
	the chimneys became locomotive, and rattled and danced about the
	floors, and round the heads of the commissioners, all the night long.
	On the eleventh, the demon ran away with their breeches; and on the
	twelfth filled their beds so full of pewter platters that they could not
	get into them. On the thirteenth night, the glass became unaccountably
	seized with a fit of cracking, and fell into shivers in all parts of
	the house. On the fourteenth, there was a noise as if forty pieces of
	artillery had been fired off, and a shower of pebble-stones, which so
	alarmed the commissioners that, “struck with great horror, they
	cried out to one another for help.”</p>

	<p>They first of all tried the efficacy of prayers to drive away the evil
	spirits; but these proving unavailing, they began seriously to reflect
	whether it would not be much better to leave the place altogether to
	the devils that inhabited it. They ultimately resolved, however, to
	try it a little longer; and having craved forgiveness of all their sins,
	betook themselves to bed. That night they slept in tolerable comfort,
	but it was merely a trick of their tormentor to lull them into
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"></a>false security. When, on the succeeding night, they heard no noises,
	they began to flatter themselves that the devil was driven out, and
	prepared accordingly to take up their quarters for the whole winter
	in the palace. These symptoms on their part became the signal for
	renewed uproar among the fiends. On the 1st of November, they
	heard something walking with a slow and solemn pace up and down
	the withdrawing-room, and immediately afterwards a shower of stones,
	bricks, mortar, and broken glass pelted about their ears. On the
	2d the steps were again heard in the withdrawing-room, sounding to
	their fancy very much like the treading of an enormous bear, which
	continued for about a quarter of an hour. This noise having ceased,
	a large warming-pan was thrown violently upon the table, followed
	by a number of stones and the jawbone of a horse. Some of the
	boldest walked valiantly into the withdrawing-room, armed with
	swords and pistols; but could discover nothing. They were afraid
	that night to go to sleep, and sat up, making fires in every room,
	and burning candles and lamps in great abundance; thinking that,
	as the fiends loved darkness, they would not disturb a company surrounded
	with so much light. They were deceived, however: buckets
	of water came down the chimneys and extinguished the fires; and the
	candles were blown out, they knew not how. Some of the servants
	who had betaken themselves to bed were drenched with putrid ditch-water
	as they lay, and arose in great fright, muttering incoherent
	prayers, and exposing to the wondering eyes of the commissioners
	their linen all dripping with green moisture, and their knuckles red
	with the blows they had at the same time received from some invisible
	tormentors. While they were still speaking, there was a noise
	like the loudest thunder, or the firing of a whole park of artillery,
	upon which they all fell down upon their knees and implored the
	protection of the Almighty. One of the commissioners then arose, the
	others still kneeling, and asked in a courageous voice, and in the name
	of God, who was there, and what they had done that they should be
	troubled in that manner. No answer was returned, and the noises
	ceased for a while. At length, however, as the commissioners said,
	“the devil came again, and brought with it seven devils worse than
	itself.” Being again in darkness, they lighted a candle and placed it
	in the doorway, that it might throw a light upon the two chambers
	at once; but it was suddenly blown out, and one commissioner said
	that he had “seen the similitude of a horse’s hoof striking the candle
	and candlestick into the middle of the chamber, and afterwards making
	three scrapes on the snuff to put it out.” Upon this, the same
	person was so bold as to draw his sword; but he asserted positively
	that he had hardly withdrawn it from the scabbard before an invisible
	<a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"></a>hand seized hold of it and tugged with him for it, and prevailing,
	struck him so violent a blow with the pommel that he was quite
	stunned. Then the noises began again; upon which, with one accord,
	they all retired into the presence-chamber, where they passed the
	night, praying and singing psalms.</p>

	<p>They were by this time convinced that it was useless to struggle
	any longer with the powers of evil that seemed determined to make
	Woodstock their own. These things happened on the Saturday night;
	and being repeated on the Sunday, they determined to leave the place
	immediately, and return to London. By Tuesday morning early, all
	their preparations were completed; and, shaking the dust off their
	feet, and devoting Woodstock and all its inhabitants to the infernal
	gods, they finally took their departure.<a href="#fn43" id="fnm43" title="Dr. H. More’s..." class="fnmarker">43</a></p>
	
	<p>Many years elapsed before the true cause of these disturbances
	was discovered. It was ascertained at the Restoration, that the
	whole was the work of Giles Sharp, the trusty clerk of the commissioners.
	This man, whose real name was Joseph Collins, was a concealed
	royalist, and had passed his early life within the bowers of
	Woodstock; so that he knew every hole and corner of the place, and
	the numerous trap-doors and secret passages that abounded in the
	building. The commissioners, never suspecting the true state of his
	opinions, but believing him to be revolutionary to the back-bone,
	placed the utmost reliance upon him; a confidence which he abused
	in the manner above detailed, to his own great amusement and that
	of the few cavaliers whom he let into the secret.</p>

	<p>Quite as extraordinary and as cleverly managed was the trick
	played off at Tedworth, in 1661, at the house of Mr. Mompesson, and
	which is so circumstantially narrated by the Rev. Joseph Glanvil,
	under the title of <cite>The Demon of Tedworth</cite>, and appended, among
	other proofs of witchcraft, to his noted work called <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sadducismus
	Triumphatus</cite>. About the middle of April, in the year above mentioned,
	Mr. Mompesson, having returned to his house at Tedworth
	from a journey he had taken to London, was informed by his wife,
	that during his absence they had been troubled with the most extraordinary
	noises. Three nights afterwards he heard the noise himself;
	and it appeared to him to be that of “a great knocking at his doors,
	and on the outside of his walls.” He immediately arose, dressed himself,
	took down a pair of pistols, and walked valiantly forth to discover
	the disturber, under the impression that it must be a robber; but, as
	he went, the noise seemed to travel before or behind him; and when
	he arrived at the door from which he thought it proceeded, he saw
	nothing, but still heard “a strange hollow sound.” He puzzled his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"></a>brains for a long time, and searched every corner of the house; but
	discovering nothing, he went to bed again. He was no sooner snug
	under the clothes than the noise began again more furiously than
	ever, sounding very much like a “thumping and drumming on the
	top of his house, and then by degrees going off into the air.”</p>

	<p>These things continued for several nights, when it came to the
	recollection of Mr. Mompesson that some time before he had given
	orders for the arrest and imprisonment of a wandering drummer, who
	went about the country with a large drum, disturbing quiet people and
	soliciting alms, and that he had detained the man’s drum, and that
	probably the drummer was a wizard, and had sent evil spirits to
	haunt his house to be revenged of him. He became strengthened in
	his opinion every day, especially when the noises assumed, to his
	fancy, a resemblance to the beating of a drum, “like that at the
	breaking up of a guard.” Mrs. Mompesson being brought to bed, the
	devil, or the drummer, very kindly and considerately refrained from
	making the usual riot; but, as soon as she recovered strength, began
	again “in a ruder manner than before, following and vexing the
	young children, and beating their bedsteads with so much violence
	that every one expected they would fall in pieces.” For an hour together,
	as the worthy Mr. Mompesson repeated to his wondering
	neighbours, this infernal drummer “would beat ‘Roundheads and
	Cuckolds,’ the ‘Tat-too,’ and several other points of war, as cleverly
	as any soldier.” When this had lasted long enough, he changed his
	tactics, and scratched with his iron talons under the children’s bed.
	“On the 5th of November,” says the Rev. Joseph Glanvil, “it made
	a mighty noise; and a servant observing two boards in the children’s
	room seeming to move, he bid it give him one of them. Upon which
	the board came (nothing moving it that he saw) within a yard of him.
	The man added, ‘Nay, let me have it in my hand;’ upon which the
	spirit, devil, or drummer pushed it towards him so close that he might
	touch it.” “This,” continues Glanvil, “was in the day-time, and
	was seen by a whole room full of people. That morning it left a
	sulphureous smell behind it, which was very offensive. At night the
	minister, one Mr. Cragg, and several of the neighbours came to the
	house on a visit. Mr. Cragg went to prayers with them, kneeling at
	the children’s bedside, where it then became very troublesome and
	loud. During prayer-time, the spirit withdrew into the cock-loft, but
	returned as soon as prayers were done; and then, in sight of the company,
	the chairs walked about the room of themselves, the children’s
	shoes were hurled over their heads, and every loose thing moved about
	the chamber. At the same time, a bed-staff was thrown at the minister,
	which hit him on the leg, but so favourably, that a lock of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"></a>wool could not have fallen more softly.” On another occasion, the
	blacksmith of the village, a fellow who cared neither for ghost nor
	devil, slept with John the footman, that he also might hear the disturbances
	and be cured of his incredulity, when there “came a noise
	in the room as if one had been shoeing a horse, and somewhat came,
	as it were, with a pair of pincers,” snipping and snapping at the poor
	blacksmith’s nose the greater part of the night. Next day it came
	panting like a dog out of breath; upon which some woman present
	took a bed-staff to knock at it, “which was caught suddenly out of
	her hand and thrown away; and company coming up, the room was
	presently filled with a <em>bloomy noisome smell</em>, and was very hot, though
	without fire, in a very sharp and severe winter. It continued in the
	bed, panting and scratching for an hour and a half, and then went
	into the next room, where it knocked a little, and seemed to rattle a
	chain.”</p>

	<p>The rumour of these wonderful occurrences soon spread all over
	the country, and people from far and near flocked to the haunted
	house of Tedworth, to believe or doubt as their natures led them, but
	all filled with intense curiosity. It appears, too, that the fame of
	these events reached the royal ear, and that some gentlemen were
	sent by the king to investigate the circumstances, and draw up a
	report of what they saw or heard. Whether the royal commissioners
	were more sensible men than the neighbours of Mr. Mompesson, and
	required more clear and positive evidence than they, or whether the
	powers with which they were armed to punish any body who might be
	found carrying on this deception frightened the evil-doers, is not certain;
	but Glanvil himself reluctantly confesses that all the time they
	were in the house the noises ceased, and nothing was heard or seen.
	“However,” says he, “as to the quiet of the house when the courtiers
	were there, the intermission may have been accidental, or perhaps
	the demon was not willing to give so public a testimony of those
	transactions which might possibly convince those who he had rather
	should continue in unbelief of his existence.”</p>

	<p>As soon as the royal commissioners took their departure, the infernal
	drummer recommenced his antics, and hundreds of persons
	were daily present to hear and wonder. Mr. Mompesson’s servant
	was so fortunate as not only to hear, but to see this pertinacious demon,
	for it came and stood at the foot of his bed. “The exact shape
	and proportion of it he could not discover; but he saw a great body,
	with two red and glaring eyes, which, for some time, were fixed
	steadily on him, and at length disappeared.” Innumerable were the
	antics it played. Once it purred like a cat; beat the children’s legs
	black and blue; put a long spike into Mr. Mompesson’s bed, and a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"></a>knife into his mother’s; filled the porringers with ashes; hid a Bible
	under the grate; and turned the money black in people’s pockets.
	“One night,” said Mr. Mompesson, in a letter to Mr. Glanvil, “there
	were seven or eight of these devils in the shape of men, who, as soon
	as a gun was fired, would shuffle away into an arbour;” a circumstance
	which might have convinced Mr. Mompesson of the mortal
	nature of his persecutors, if he had not been of the number of those
	worse than blind, who shut their eyes and refuse to see.</p>

	<p>In the mean time the drummer, the supposed cause of all the mischief,
	passed his time in Gloucester gaol, whither he had been committed
	as a rogue and a vagabond. Being visited one day by some
	person from the neighbourhood of Tedworth, he asked what was the
	news in Wiltshire, and whether people did not talk a great deal about
	a drumming in a gentleman’s house there? The visitor replied that
	he heard of nothing else; upon which the drummer observed, “I
	have done it; I have thus plagued him; and he shall never be quiet
	until he hath made me satisfaction for taking away my drum.” No
	doubt the fellow, who seems to have been a gipsy, spoke the truth,
	and that the gang of which he was a member knew more about the
	noises at Mr. Mompesson’s house than any body else. Upon these
	words, however, he was brought to trial at Salisbury for witchcraft;
	and, being found guilty, was sentenced to transportation; a sentence
	which, for its leniency, excited no little wonder in that age, when
	such an accusation, whether proved or not, generally insured the
	stake or the gibbet. Glanvil says that the noises ceased immediately
	the drummer was sent beyond the seas; but that, somehow or other,
	he managed to return from transportation; “by raising storms and
	affrighting the seamen, it was said;” when the disturbances were
	forthwith renewed, and continued at intervals for several years. Certainly,
	if the confederates of this roving gipsy were so pertinacious in
	tormenting poor weak Mr. Mompesson, their pertinacity is a most
	extraordinary instance of what revenge is capable of. It was believed
	by many, at the time, that Mr. Mompesson himself was privy to the
	whole matter, and permitted and encouraged these tricks in his house
	for the sake of notoriety; but it seems more probable that the gipsies
	were the real delinquents, and that Mr. Mompesson was as much
	alarmed and bewildered as his credulous neighbours, whose excited
	imaginations conjured up no small portion of these stories,</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Which rolled, and as they rolled grew larger visibly.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>Many instances of a similar kind, during the seventeenth century,
	might be gleaned from Glanvil and other writers of that period;
	but they do not differ sufficiently from these to justify a detail of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"></a>them. The most famous of all haunted houses acquired its notoriety
	much nearer our own time; and the circumstances connected with
	it are so curious, and afford so fair a specimen of the easy credulity
	even of well-informed and sensible people, as to merit a little notice
	in this chapter. The Cock-Lane Ghost, as it was called, kept London
	in commotion for a considerable time, and was the theme of
	conversation among the learned and the illiterate, and in every circle,
	from that of the prince to that of the peasant.</p>

		<p class="caption">THE HAUNTED HOUSE IN COCK LANE.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>At the commencement of the year 1760, there resided in Cock
	Lane, near West Smithfield, in the house of one Parsons, the parish
	clerk of St. Sepulchre’s, a stockbroker, named Kent. The wife of
	this gentleman had died in child-bed during the previous year, and
	his sister-in-law, Miss Fanny, had arrived from Norfolk to keep his
	house for him. They soon conceived a mutual affection, and each of
	them made a will in the other’s favour. They lived some months in
	the house of Parsons, who, being a needy man, borrowed money of
	his lodger. Some difference arose betwixt them, and Mr. Kent left
	the house, and instituted legal proceedings against the parish-clerk
	for the recovery of his money.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"></a>While this matter was yet pending, Miss Fanny was suddenly
	taken ill of the small-pox; and, notwithstanding every care and
	attention, she died in a few days, and was buried in a vault under
	Clerkenwell church. Parsons now began to hint that the poor lady
	had come unfairly by her death, and that Mr. Kent was accessory to
	it, from his too great eagerness to enter into possession of the property
	she had bequeathed him. Nothing further was said for nearly
	two years; but it would appear that Parsons was of so revengeful
	a character, that he had never forgotten or forgiven his differences
	with Mr. Kent, and the indignity of having been sued for the borrowed
	money. The strong passions of pride and avarice were silently
	at work during all that interval, hatching schemes of revenge, but
	dismissing them one after the other as impracticable, until, at last, a
	notable one suggested itself. About the beginning of the year 1762,
	the alarm was spread over all the neighbourhood of Cock Lane, that
	the house of Parsons was haunted by the ghost of poor Fanny, and
	that the daughter of Parsons, a girl about twelve years of age, had
	several times seen and conversed with the spirit, who had, moreover,
	informed her, that she had not died of the small-pox, as was currently
	reported, but of poison, administered by Mr. Kent. Parsons,
	who originated, took good care to countenance these reports; and,
	in answer to numerous inquiries, said his house was every night,
	and had been for two years, in fact, ever since the death of Fanny,
	troubled by a loud knocking at the doors and in the walls. Having
	thus prepared the ignorant and credulous neighbours to believe or
	exaggerate for themselves what he had told them, he sent for a gentleman
	of a higher class in life, to come and witness these extraordinary
	occurrences. The gentleman came accordingly, and found the
	daughter of Parsons, to whom the spirit alone appeared, and whom
	alone it answered, in bed, trembling violently, having just seen the
	ghost, and been again informed that she had died from poison. A
	loud knocking was also heard from every part of the chamber, which
	so mystified the not very clear understanding of the visitor, that he
	departed, afraid to doubt and ashamed to believe, but with a promise
	to bring the clergyman of the parish and several other gentlemen on
	the following day, to report upon the mystery.</p>

	<p>On the following night he returned, bringing with him three
	clergymen, and about twenty other persons, including two negroes,
	when, upon a consultation with Parsons, they resolved to sit up the
	whole night, and await the ghost’s arrival. It was then explained by
	Parsons, that although the ghost would never render itself visible to
	any body but his daughter, it had no objection to answer the questions
	that might be put to it, by any person present, and that it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"></a>expressed an affirmation by one knock, a negative by two, and its displeasure
	by a kind of scratching. The child was then put into bed
	along with her sister, and the clergymen examined the bed and bed-clothes
	to satisfy themselves that no trick was played, by knocking
	upon any substance concealed among the clothes. As on the previous
	night, the bed was observed to shake violently.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>After some hours, during which they all waited with exemplary
	patience, the mysterious knocking was heard in the wall, and the
	child declared that she saw the ghost of poor Fanny. The following
	questions were then gravely
	put by the clergyman,
	through the medium of one
	Mary Frazer, the servant of
	Parsons, and to whom it
	was said the deceased lady
	had been much attached.
	The answers were in the
	usual fashion, by a knock
	or knocks:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Do you make this disturbance
		on account of the
		ill-usage you received from
		Mr. Kent?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Were you brought to an untimely end by poison?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“How was the poison administered, in beer or purl?”—“In purl.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"></a>“How long was that before your death?”—“About three hours.”</p>

		<p>“Can your former servant, Carrots, give any information about
		the poison?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Are you Kent’s wife’s sister?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Were you married to Kent after your sister’s death?”—“No.”</p>

		<p>“Was any body else, besides Kent, concerned in your murder?”—“No.”</p>

		<p>“Can you, if you like, appear visibly to any one?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Will you do so?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Can you go out of this house?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Is it your intention to follow this child about every where?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Are you pleased in being asked these questions?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Does it ease your troubled soul?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>[Here there was heard a mysterious noise, which some wiseacre
		present compared to the fluttering of wings.]</p>

		<p>“How long before your death did you tell your servant, Carrots,
		that you were poisoned? An hour?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>[Carrots, who was present, was appealed to; but she stated positively
		that such was not the fact, as the deceased was quite speechless
		an hour before her death. This shook the faith of some of the spectators,
		but the examination was allowed to continue.]</p>

		<p>“How long did Carrots live with you?”—“Three or four days.”</p>

		<p>[Carrots was again appealed to, and said that this was true.]</p>

		<p>“If Mr. Kent is arrested for this murder, will he confess?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Would your soul be at rest if he were hanged for it?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“Will he be hanged for it?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>“How long a time first?”—“Three years.”</p>

		<p>“How many clergymen are there in this room?”—“Three.”</p>

		<p>“How many negroes?”—“Two.”</p>

		<p>“Is this watch (held up by one of the clergymen) white?”—“No.”</p>

		<p>“Is it yellow?”—“No.”</p>

		<p>“Is it blue?”—“No.”</p>

		<p>“Is it black?”—“Yes.”</p>

		<p>[The watch was in a black shagreen case.]</p>

		<p>“At what time this morning will you take your departure?”</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>The answer to this question was four knocks, very distinctly heard
	by every person present; and accordingly, at four o’clock precisely
	the ghost took its departure to the Wheatsheaf public-house close by,
	where it frightened mine host and his lady almost out of their wits,
	by knocking in the ceiling right above their bed.</p>

	<p>The rumour of these occurrences very soon spread over London,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"></a>and every day Cock Lane was rendered impassable by the crowds of
	people who assembled around the house of the parish clerk, in expectation
	of either seeing the ghost or of hearing the mysterious
	knocks. It was at last found necessary, so clamorous were they for
	admission within the haunted precincts, to admit those only who
	would pay a certain fee, an arrangement which was very convenient
	to the needy and money-loving Mr. Parsons. Indeed, things had
	taken a turn greatly to his satisfaction; he not only had his revenge,
	but he made a profit out of it. The ghost, in consequence, played
	its antics every night, to the great amusement of many hundreds of
	people and the great perplexity of a still greater number.</p>

	<p>Unhappily, however, for the parish clerk, the ghost was induced
	to make some promises which were the means of utterly destroying
	its reputation. It promised, in answer to the questions of the Rev.
	Mr. Aldritch of Clerkenwell, that it would not only follow the little
	Miss Parsons wherever she went, but would also attend him, or any
	other gentleman, into the vault under St. John’s Church, where the
	body of the murdered woman was deposited, and would there give
	notice of its presence by a distinct knock upon the coffin. As a preliminary,
	the girl was conveyed to the house of Mr. Aldritch near
	the church, where a large party of ladies and gentlemen, eminent
	for their acquirements, their rank, or their wealth, had assembled.
	About ten o’clock on the night of the first of February, the girl
	having been brought from Cock Lane in a coach, was put to bed by
	several ladies in the house of Mr. Aldritch; a strict examination having
	been previously made that nothing was hidden in the bed-clothes. While
	the gentlemen in an adjoining chamber were deliberating whether they
	should proceed in a body to the vault, they were summoned into the
	bedroom by the ladies, who affirmed, in great alarm, that the ghost
	was come, and that they heard the knocks and scratches. The gentlemen
	entered accordingly, with a determination to suffer no deception.
	The little girl, on being asked whether she saw the ghost,
	replied, “No; but she felt it on her back like a mouse.” She was
	then required to put her hands out of bed, and they being held by
	some of the ladies, the spirit was summoned in the usual manner
	to answer, if it were in the room. The question was several times
	put with great solemnity; but the customary knock was not heard
	in reply in the walls, neither was there any scratching. The ghost
	was then asked to render itself visible, but it did not choose to grant
	the request. It was next solicited to give some token of its presence
	by a sound of any sort, or by touching the hand or cheek of any
	lady or gentleman in the room; but even with this request the ghost
	would not comply.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page233" title="233"></a>There was now a considerable pause, and one of the clergymen
	went down stairs to interrogate the father of the girl, who was waiting
	the result of the experiment. He positively denied that there
	was any deception, and even went so far as to say that he himself,
	upon one occasion, had seen and conversed with the awful ghost.
	This having been communicated to the company, it was unanimously
	resolved to give the ghost another trial; and the clergyman called
	out in a loud voice to the supposed spirit, that the gentleman to
	whom it had promised to appear in the vault was about to repair to
	that place, where he claimed the fulfilment of its promise. At one
	hour after midnight they all proceeded to the church, and the gentleman
	in question, with another, entered the vault alone, and took
	up their position alongside of the coffin of poor Fanny. The ghost was
	then summoned to appear, but it appeared not; it was summoned
	to knock, but it knocked not; it was summoned to scratch, but it
	scratched not; and the two retired from the vault, with a firm belief
	that the whole business was a deception practised by Parsons and
	his daughter. There were others, however, who did not wish to
	jump so hastily to a conclusion, and who suggested that they were
	perhaps trifling with this awful and supernatural being, which, being
	offended with them for their presumption, would not condescend
	to answer them. Again, after serious consultation, it was agreed on
	all hands that if the ghost answered any body at all, it would answer
	Mr. Kent, the supposed murderer; and he was accordingly requested
	to go down into the vault. He went with several others, and summoned
	the ghost to answer whether he had indeed poisoned her.
	There being no answer, the question was put by Mr. Aldritch, who
	conjured it, if it were indeed a spirit, to end their doubts, make a
	sign of its presence, and point out the guilty person. There being
	still no answer for the space of half an hour, during which time all
	these boobies waited with the most praiseworthy perseverance, they
	returned to the house of Mr. Aldritch, and ordered the girl to get
	up and dress herself. She was strictly examined, but persisted in
	her statement that she used no deception, and that the ghost had
	really appeared to her.</p>

	<p>So many persons had, by their openly expressed belief of the reality
	of the visitation, identified themselves with it, that Parsons and
	his family were far from being the only persons interested in the continuance
	of the delusion. The result of the experiment convinced
	most people; but these were not to be convinced by any evidence, however
	positive, and they therefore spread abroad the rumour, that the
	ghost had not appeared in the vault because Mr. Kent had taken care
	beforehand to have the coffin removed. That gentleman, whose position
	<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"></a>was a very painful one, immediately procured competent witnesses,
	in whose presence the vault was entered, and the coffin of
	poor Fanny opened. Their depositions were then published; and Mr.
	Kent indicted Parsons and his wife, his daughter, Mary Frazer the
	servant, the Rev. Mr. Moor, and a tradesman, two of the most prominent
	patrons of the deception, for a conspiracy. The trial came
	on in the Court of King’s Bench, on the 10th of July, before Lord
	Chief-Justice Mansfield, when, after an investigation which lasted
	twelve hours, the whole of the conspirators were found guilty. The
	Rev. Mr. Moor and his friend were severely reprimanded in open
	court, and recommended to make some pecuniary compensation
	to the prosecutor for the aspersions they had been instrumental in
	throwing upon his character. Parsons was sentenced to stand three
	times in the pillory, and to be imprisoned for two years; his wife
	to one year’s, and his servant to six months’ imprisonment in the
	Bridewell. A printer, who had been employed by them to publish
	an account of the proceedings for their profit, was also fined fifty
	pounds, and discharged.</p>

	<p>The precise manner in which the deception was carried on has
	never been explained. The knocking in the wall appears to have
	been the work of Parsons’ wife, while the scratching part of the
	business was left to the little girl. That any contrivance so clumsy
	could have deceived any body cannot fail to excite our wonder. But
	thus it always is. If two or three persons can only be found to take
	the lead in any absurdity, however great, there is sure to be plenty
	of imitators. Like sheep in a field, if one clears the stile, the rest
	will follow.</p>

	<p>About ten years afterwards, London was again alarmed by the
	story of a haunted house. Stockwell, near Vauxhall, the scene of
	the antics of this new ghost, became almost as celebrated in the
	annals of superstition as Cock Lane. Mrs. Golding, an elderly lady,
	who resided alone with her servant, Anne Robinson, was sorely surprised
	on the evening of Twelfth-Day, 1772, to observe a most extraordinary
	commotion among her crockery. Cups and saucers rattled
	down the chimney—pots and pans were whirled down stairs, or
	through the windows; and hams, cheeses, and loaves of bread disported
	themselves upon the floor as if the devil were in them. This,
	at least, was the conclusion that Mrs. Golding came to; and being
	greatly alarmed, she invited some of her neighbours to stay with her,
	and protect her from the evil one. Their presence, however, did not
	put a stop to the insurrection of china, and every room in the house
	was in a short time strewed with the fragments. The chairs and
	tables joined, at last, in the tumult, and things looked altogether so
	<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"></a>serious and inexplicable, that the neighbours, dreading that the house
	itself would next be seized with a fit of motion, and tumble about
	their ears, left poor Mrs. Golding to bear the brunt of it by herself.
	The ghost in this case was solemnly remonstrated with, and urged to
	take its departure; but the demolition continuing as great as before,
	Mrs. Golding finally made up her mind to quit the house altogether.
	She took refuge with Anne Robinson in the house of a neighbour;
	but his glass and crockery being immediately subjected to the same
	persecution, he was reluctantly compelled to give her notice to quit.
	The old lady thus forced back to her own house, endured the disturbance
	for some days longer, when suspecting that Anne Robinson was
	the cause of all the mischief, she dismissed her from her service. The
	extraordinary appearances immediately ceased, and were never afterwards
	renewed; a fact which is of itself sufficient to point out the
	real disturber. A long time afterwards, Anne Robinson confessed
	the whole matter to the Reverend Mr. Brayfield. This gentleman
	confided the story to Mr. Hone, who has published an explanation
	of the mystery. Anne, it appears, was anxious to have a clear house,
	to carry on an intrigue with her lover, and resorted to this trick to
	effect her purpose. She placed the china on the shelves in such a
	manner that it fell on the slightest motion, and attached horse-hairs
	to other articles, so that she could jerk them down from an adjoining
	room without being perceived by any one. She was exceedingly dexterous
	at this sort of work, and would have proved a formidable rival
	to many a juggler by profession. A full explanation of the whole
	affair may be found in the <cite>Every-day Book</cite>.</p>

	<p>The latest instance of the popular panic occasioned by a house
	supposed to be haunted, occurred in Scotland, in the winter of the
	year 1838. On the 5th of December, the inmates of the farm-house
	of Baldarroch, in the district of Banchory, Aberdeenshire, were
	alarmed by observing a great number of sticks, pebble-stones, and
	clods of earth flying about their yard and premises. They endeavoured,
	but in vain, to discover who was the delinquent; and the
	shower of stones continuing for five days in succession, they came at
	last to the conclusion that the devil and his imps were alone the
	cause of it. The rumour soon spread over all that part of the country,
	and hundreds of persons came from far and near to witness the
	antics of the devils of Baldarroch. After the fifth day, the shower of
	clods and stones ceased on the outside of the premises, and the scene
	shifted to the interior. Spoons, knives, plates, mustard-pots, rolling-pins,
	and flat-irons appeared suddenly endued with the power of
	self-motion, and were whirled from room to room, and rattled down
	the chimneys in a manner which nobody could account for. The lid
	<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"></a>of a mustard-pot was put into a cupboard by the servant-girl in the
	presence of scores of people, and in a few minutes afterwards came
	bouncing down the chimney, to the consternation of every body. There
	was also a tremendous knocking at the doors and on the roof, and
	pieces of stick and pebble-stones rattled against the windows and
	broke them. The whole neighbourhood was a scene of alarm; and
	not only the vulgar, but persons of education, respectable farmers,
	within a circle of twenty miles, expressed their belief in the supernatural
	character of these events, and offered up devout prayers to be
	preserved from the machinations of the Evil One. The note of fear
	being once sounded, the visitors, as is generally the case in all tales
	of wonder, strove with each other who should witness the most extraordinary
	occurrences; and within a week, it was generally believed
	in the parishes of Banchory-Ternan, Drumoak, Durris, Kincardine-O’Neil,
	and all the circumjacent districts of Mearns and Aberdeenshire,
	that the devil had been seen in the act of hammering upon the
	house-top of Baldarroch. One old man asserted positively that, one
	night, after having been to see the strange gambols of the knives and
	mustard-pots, he met the phantom of a great black man, “who
	wheeled round his head with a whizzing noise, making a wind about
	his ears that almost blew his bonnet off,” and that he was haunted by
	him in this manner for three miles. It was also affirmed and believed,
	that all horses and dogs that approached this enchanted ground were
	immediately affected; that a gentleman, slow of faith, had been cured
	of his incredulity by meeting the butter-churn jumping in at the door
	as he himself was going out; that the roofs of houses had been torn
	off, and that several ricks in the corn-yard had danced a quadrille
	together, to the sound of the devil’s bagpipes re-echoing from the
	mountain-tops. The women in the family of the persecuted farmer
	of Baldarroch also kept their tongues in perpetual motion; swelling
	with their strange stories the tide of popular wonder. The goodwife
	herself, and all her servants, said that, whenever they went to bed,
	they were attacked with stones and other missiles, some of which
	came below the blankets and gently tapped their toes. One evening,
	a shoe suddenly darted across a garret where some labourers were
	sitting, and one of the men, who attempted to catch it, swore positively
	that it was so hot and heavy he was unable to hold it. It was
	also said that the bearbeater (a sort of mortar used to bruise barley
	in)—an object of such weight that it requires several men to move it—spontaneously
	left the barn and flew over the house-top, alighting
	at the feet of one of the servant-maids, and hitting her, but without
	hurting her in the least, or even causing her any alarm; it being a
	fact well known to her, that all objects thus thrown about by the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"></a>devil lost their specific gravity, and could harm nobody, even though
	they fell upon a person’s head.</p>

	<p>Among the persons drawn to Baldarroch by these occurrences
	were the heritor, the minister, and all the elders of the Kirk, under
	whose superintendence an investigation was immediately commenced.
	Their proceedings were not promulgated for some days; and, in the
	mean time, rumour continued to travel through all the Highlands,
	magnifying each mysterious incident the farther it got from home.
	It was said, that when the goodwife put her potato-pot on the fire,
	each potato, as the water boiled, changed into a demon, and grinned
	horribly at her as she lifted the lid; that not only chairs and tables,
	but carrots and turnips, skipped along the floor in the merriest manner
	imaginable; that shoes and boots went through all the evolutions
	of the Highland fling without any visible wearers directing their
	motions; and that a piece of meat detached itself from the hook on
	which it hung in the pantry, and placed itself before the fire, whence
	all the efforts of the people of the house were unable to remove it
	until it was thoroughly roasted; and that it then flew up the chimney
	with a tremendous bang. At Baldarroch itself the belief was not
	quite so extravagant; but the farmer was so convinced that the devil
	and his imps were alone the cause of all the disturbance, that he travelled
	a distance of forty miles to an old conjuror, named Willie Foreman,
	to induce him, for a handsome fee, to remove the enchantment
	from his property. There were, of course, some sensible and educated
	people, who, after stripping the stories circulated of their exaggeration,
	attributed all the rest to one or other of two causes; first,
	that some gipsies, or strolling mendicants, hidden in the neighbouring
	plantation, were amusing themselves by working on the credulity
	of the country people; or, secondly, that the inmates of Baldarroch
	carried on this deception themselves, for some reason or other, which
	was not very clear to any body. The last opinion gained but few
	believers, as the farmer and his family were much respected; and so
	many persons had, in the most open manner, expressed their belief in
	the supernatural agency, that they did not like to stultify themselves
	by confessing that they had been deceived.</p>

	<p>At last, after a fortnight’s continuance of the noises, the whole
	trick was discovered. The two servant lasses were strictly examined,
	and then committed to prison. It appeared that they were alone at
	the bottom of the whole affair, and that the extraordinary alarm and
	credulity of their master and mistress, in the first instance, and of
	the neighbours and country people afterwards, made their task comparatively
	easy. A little common dexterity was all they had used;
	and, being themselves unsuspected, they swelled the alarm by the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238"></a>wonderful stories they invented. It was they who loosened the bricks
	in the chimneys, and placed the dishes in such a manner on the
	shelves, that they fell on the slightest motion. In short, they played
	the same tricks as those used by the servant girl at Stockwell, with
	the same results, and for the same purpose—the gratification of a
	love of mischief. They were no sooner secured in the county gaol
	than the noises ceased, and most people were convinced that human
	agency alone had worked all the wonder. Some few of the most devoutly
	superstitious still held out in their first belief, and refused to
	listen to any explanation.</p>

	<p>These tales of haunted houses, especially those of the last and
	present century, however they may make us blush for popular folly,
	are yet gratifying in their results; for they shew that society has
	made a vast improvement. Had Parsons and his wife, and the other
	contrivers of the Cock Lane deception, lived two hundred years earlier,
	they would not perhaps have found a greater number of dupes, but
	they would have been hanged as witches, instead of being imprisoned
	as vagabonds. The ingenious Anne Robinson and the sly lasses of
	Baldarroch would doubtless have met a similar fate. Thus it is
	pleasant to reflect, that though there may be as much folly and credulity
	in the world as ever in one class of society, there is more wisdom
	and mercy in another than ever were known before. Lawgivers,
	by blotting from the statute-book the absurd or sanguinary enactments
	of their predecessors, have made one step towards teaching the
	people. It is to be hoped that the day is not far distant when lawgivers
	will teach the people by some more direct means, and prevent
	the recurrence of delusions like these, and many worse, which might
	be cited, by securing to every child born within their dominions an
	education in accordance with the advancing state of civilisation. If
	ghosts and witches are not yet altogether exploded, it is the fault,
	not so much of the ignorant people, as of the law and the government
	that have neglected to enlighten them.</p>

	a never-failing source of amusement to
	the man whose sympathies are hospitable
	enough to embrace all his kind,
	and who, refined though he may be
	himself, will not sneer at the humble
	wit or grotesque peculiarities of the
	boozing mechanic, the squalid beggar,
	the vicious urchin, and all the motley
	group of the idle, the reckless, and the
	imitative that swarm in the alleys and
	broadways of a metropolis. He who
	walks through a great city to find subjects
	for weeping, may find plenty at
	every corner to wring his heart; but
	let such a man walk on his course, and
	enjoy his grief alone—we are not of those who would accompany him.
	The miseries of us poor earth-dwellers gain no alleviation from the sympathy
	of those who merely hunt them out to be pathetic over them.
	The weeping philosopher too often impairs his eyesight by his woe,
	and becomes unable from his tears to see the remedies for the evils
	which he deplores. Thus it will often be found that the man of no
	tears is the truest philanthropist, as he is the best physician who wears
	a cheerful face, even in the worst of cases.</p>
	
	<p>So many pens have been employed to point out the miseries, and
	so many to condemn the crimes and vices, and more serious follies of
	the multitude, that ours shall not increase the number, at least in
	this chapter. Our present task shall be less ungracious, and wandering
	through the busy haunts of great cities, we shall seek only for
	amusement, and note as we pass a few of the harmless follies and
	whimsies of the poor.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"></a>And, first of all, walk where we will, we cannot help hearing from
	every side a phrase repeated with delight, and received with laughter,
	by men with hard hands and dirty faces, by saucy butcher lads and
	errand-boys, by loose women, by hackney coachmen, cabriolet-drivers,
	and idle fellows who loiter at the corners of streets. Not one utters
	this phrase without producing a laugh from all within hearing. It
	seems applicable to every circumstance, and is the universal answer
	to every question; in short, it is the favourite slang phrase of the
	day, a phrase that, while its brief season of popularity lasts, throws
	a dash of fun and frolicsomeness over the existence of squalid poverty
	and ill-requited labour, and gives them reason to laugh as well as
	their more fortunate fellows in a higher stage of society.</p>

	<p>London is peculiarly fertile in this sort of phrases, which spring
	up suddenly, no one knows exactly in what spot, and pervade the
	whole population in a few hours, no one knows how. Many years
	ago the favourite phrase (for, though but a monosyllable, it was a
	phrase in itself) was Quoz. This odd word took the fancy of the multitude
	in an extraordinary degree, and very soon acquired an almost
	boundless meaning. When vulgar wit wished to mark its incredulity,
	and raise a laugh at the same time, there was no resource so sure as
	this popular piece of slang. When a man was asked a favour which
	he did not choose to grant, he marked his sense of the suitor’s unparalleled
	presumption by exclaiming <em>Quoz!</em> When a mischievous urchin
	wished to annoy a passenger, and create mirth for his comrades, he
	looked him in the face, and cried out <em>Quoz!</em> and the exclamation
	never failed in its object. When a disputant was desirous of throwing
	a doubt upon the veracity of his opponent, and getting summarily
	rid of an argument which he could not overturn, he uttered the word
	<em>Quoz</em>, with a contemptuous curl of his lip, and an impatient shrug of
	his shoulders. The universal monosyllable conveyed all his meaning,
	and not only told his opponent that he lied, but that he erred egregiously
	if he thought that any one was such a nincompoop as to believe
	him. Every alehouse resounded with <em>Quoz</em>; every street-corner
	was noisy with it, and every wall for miles around was chalked
	with it.</p>

	<p>But, like all other earthly things, <em>Quoz</em> had its season, and
	passed away as suddenly as it arose, never again to be the pet and the
	idol of the populace. A new claimant drove it from its place, and
	held undisputed sway till, in its turn, it was hurled from its pre-eminence,
	and a successor appointed in its stead.</p>

	<p>“<em>What a shocking bad hat!</em>” was the phrase that was next in
	vogue. No sooner had it become universal, than thousands of idle
	but sharp eyes were on the watch for the passenger whose hat shewed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"></a>any signs, however slight, of ancient service. Immediately the cry
	arose, and, like the war-whoop of the Indians, was repeated by a
	hundred discordant throats. He was a wise man who, finding himself
	under these circumstances “the observed of all observers,” bore
	his honours meekly. He who shewed symptoms of ill-feeling at the
	imputations cast upon his hat, only brought upon himself redoubled
	notice. The mob soon perceive whether a man is irritable, and, if
	of their own class, they love to make sport of him. When such a man,
	and with such a hat, passed in those days through a crowded neighbourhood,
	he might think himself fortunate if his annoyances were
	confined to the shouts and cries of the populace. The obnoxious hat
	was often snatched from his head and thrown into the gutter by some
	practical joker, and then raised, covered with mud, upon the end of
	a stick, for the admiration of the spectators, who held their sides with
	laughter, and exclaimed, in the pauses of their mirth, “<em>Oh, what a
	shocking bad hat!</em>” “<em>What a shocking bad hat!</em>” Many a nervous
	poor man, whose purse could but ill spare the outlay, doubtless purchased
	a new hat before the time, in order to avoid exposure in this
	manner.</p>

	<p>The origin of this singular saying, which made fun for the metropolis
	for months, is not involved in the same obscurity as that which
	shrouds the origin of <em>Quoz</em> and some others. There had been a hotly
	contested election for the borough of Southwark, and one of the candidates
	was an eminent hatter. This gentleman, in canvassing the
	electors, adopted a somewhat professional mode of conciliating their
	good-will, and of bribing them without letting them perceive that
	they were bribed. Whenever he called upon or met a voter whose
	hat was not of the best material, or, being so, had seen its best
	days, he invariably said, “<em>What a shocking bad hat you have got;
	call at my warehouse, and you shall have a new one!</em>” Upon the
	day of election this circumstance was remembered, and his opponents
	made the most of it, by inciting the crowd to keep up an
	incessant cry of “<em>What a shocking bad hat!</em>” all the time the honourable
	candidate was addressing them. From Southwark the phrase
	spread over all London, and reigned for a time the supreme slang of
	the season.</p>

	<p><em>Hookey Walker</em>, derived from the chorus of a popular ballad, was
	also high in favour at one time, and served, like its predecessor <em>Quoz</em>,
	to answer all questions. In the course of time, the latter word alone
	became the favourite, and was uttered with a peculiar drawl upon the
	first syllable, and a sharp turn upon the last. If a lively servant girl
	was importuned for a kiss by a fellow she did not care about, she
	cocked her little nose, and cried “<em>Walker!</em>” If a dustman asked his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242"></a>friend for the loan of a shilling, and his friend was either unable or
	unwilling to accommodate him, the probable answer he would receive
	was, “<em>Walker!</em>” If a drunken man was reeling about the streets,
	and a boy pulled his coat-tails, or a man knocked his hat over his
	eyes to make fun of him, the joke was always accompanied by the
	same exclamation. This lasted for two or three months, and “<em>Walker!</em>”
	walked off the stage, never more to be revived for the entertainment
	of that or any future generation.</p>

	<p>The next phrase was a most preposterous one. Who invented it,
	how it arose, or where it was first heard, are alike unknown. Nothing
	about it is certain, but that for months it was <em>the</em> slang <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
	excellence</em> of the Londoners, and afforded them a vast gratification.
	“<em>There he goes with his eye out!</em>” or “<em>There she goes with her eye
	out!</em>” as the sex of the party alluded to might be, was in the mouth
	of every body who knew the town. The sober part of the community
	were as much puzzled by this unaccountable saying as the vulgar
	were delighted with it. The wise thought it very foolish, but the
	many thought it very funny, and the idle amused themselves by
	chalking it upon walls, or scribbling it upon monuments. But
	“all that’s bright must fade,” even in slang. The people grew tired
	of their hobby, and “<em>There he goes with his eye out!</em>” was heard no
	more in its accustomed haunts.</p>

	<p>Another very odd phrase came into repute in a brief space afterwards,
	in the form of the impertinent and not universally apposite
	query, “<em>Has your mother sold her mangle?</em>” But its popularity was not
	of that boisterous and cordial kind which ensures a long continuance
	of favour. What tended to impede its progress was, that it could not
	be well applied to the older portions of society. It consequently ran
	but a brief career, and then sank into oblivion. Its successor enjoyed a
	more extended fame, and laid its foundations so deep, that years and
	changing fashions have not sufficed to eradicate it. This phrase was
	“<em>Flare up!</em>” and it is, even now, a colloquialism in common use.
	It took its rise in the time of the Reform riots, when Bristol was
	nearly half burned by the infuriated populace. The flames were said
	to have <em>flared up</em> in the devoted city. Whether there was any thing
	peculiarly captivating in the sound, or in the idea of these words, is
	hard to say; but whatever was the reason, it tickled the mob-fancy
	mightily, and drove all other slang out of the field before it. Nothing
	was to be heard all over London but “<em>flare up!</em>” It answered
	all questions, settled all disputes, was applied to all persons, all things,
	and all circumstances, and became suddenly the most comprehensive
	phrase in the English language. The man who had overstepped the
	bounds of decorum in his speech was said to have <em>flared up</em>; he who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243"></a>had paid visits too repeated to the gin-shop, and got damaged in consequence,
	had <em>flared up</em>. To put one’s self into a passion; to stroll
	out on a nocturnal frolic, and alarm a neighbourhood, or to create a
	disturbance in any shape, was to <em>flare up</em>. A lovers’ quarrel was a
	<em>flare up</em>; so was a boxing-match between two blackguards in the
	streets; and the preachers of sedition and revolution recommended
	the English nation to <em>flare up</em>, like the French. So great a favourite
	was the word, that people loved to repeat it for its very sound. They
	delighted apparently in hearing their own organs articulate it; and
	labouring men, when none who could respond to the call were within
	hearing, would often startle the aristocratic echoes of the West by
	the well-known slang phrase of the East. Even in the dead hours
	of the night, the ears of those who watched late, or who could not
	sleep, were saluted with the same sound. The drunkard reeling
	home shewed that he was still a man and a citizen, by calling “<em>flare
	up!</em>” in the pauses of his hiccough. Drink had deprived him of the
	power of arranging all other ideas; his intellect was sunk to the
	level of the brute’s; but he clung to humanity by the one last link
	of the popular cry. While he could vociferate that sound, he had
	rights as an Englishman, and would not sleep in a gutter, like a
	dog! Onwards he went, disturbing quiet streets and comfortable
	people by his whoop, till exhausted nature could support him no
	more, and he rolled powerless into the road. When, in due time
	afterwards, the policeman stumbled upon him as he lay, that guardian
	of the peace turned the full light of his lantern on his face, and
	exclaimed, “Here’s a poor devil who has been <em>flaring up!</em>” Then
	came the stretcher, on which the victim of deep potations was carried
	to the watch-house, and pitched into a dirty cell, among a score of
	wretches about as far gone as himself, who saluted their new comrade
	by a loud, long shout of <em>flare up!</em></p>

	<p>So universal was this phrase, and so enduring seemed its popularity,
	that a speculator, who knew not the evanescence of slang, established
	a weekly newspaper under its name. But he was like the man
	who built his house upon the sand; his foundation gave way under
	him, and the phrase and the newspaper were washed into the mighty
	sea of the things that were. The people grew at last weary of
	the monotony, and “<em>flare up</em>” became vulgar even among them.
	Gradually it was left to little boys who did not know the world,
	and in process of time sank altogether into neglect. It is now
	heard no more as a piece of popular slang; but the words are still
	used to signify any sudden outburst either of fire, disturbance, or ill-nature.</p>

	<p>The next phrase that enjoyed the favour of the million was less
	<a class="pagenum" id="page244" title="244"></a>concise, and seems to have been originally aimed against precocious
	youths who gave themselves the airs of manhood before their time.
	“<em>Does your mother know you’re out?</em>” was the provoking query addressed
	to young men of more than reasonable swagger, who smoked
	cigars in the streets, and wore false whiskers to look irresistible. We
	have seen many a conceited fellow who could not suffer a woman to
	pass him without staring her out of countenance, reduced at once
	into his natural insignificance by the mere utterance of this phrase.
	Apprentice lads and shopmen in their Sunday clothes held the words
	in abhorrence, and looked fierce when they were applied to them.
	Altogether the phrase had a very salutary effect, and in a thousand
	instances shewed young Vanity that it was not half so pretty and
	engaging as it thought itself. What rendered it so provoking was
	the doubt it implied as to the capability of self-guidance possessed by
	the individual to whom it was addressed. “<em>Does your mother know
	you’re out?</em>” was a query of mock concern and solicitude, implying
	regret and concern that one so young and inexperienced in the ways
	of a great city should be allowed to wander abroad without the guidance
	of a parent. Hence the great wrath of those who verged on
	manhood, but had not reached it, whenever they were made the subject
	of it. Even older heads did not like it; and the heir of a ducal
	house, and inheritor of a warrior’s name, to whom they were applied
	by a cabriolet-driver who was ignorant of his rank, was so indignant
	at the affront, that he summoned the offender before the magisterial
	bench. The fellow had wished to impose upon his lordship by asking
	double the fare he was entitled to; and when his lordship resisted
	the demand, he was insultingly asked “if his mother knew he was
	out?” All the drivers on the stand joined in the query, and his lordship
	was fain to escape their laughter by walking away with as much
	haste as his dignity would allow. The man pleaded ignorance that his
	customer was a lord, but offended justice fined him for his mistake.</p>

	<p>When this phrase had numbered its appointed days, it died away
	like its predecessors, and “<em>Who are you?</em>” reigned in its stead. This
	new favourite, like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in a night,
	or, like a frog in Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower.
	One day it was unheard, unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded
	London. Every alley resounded with it; every highway was musical
	with it,</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“And street to street, and lane to lane flung back</p>
		<p>The one unvarying cry.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">The phrase was uttered quickly, and with a sharp sound upon the
	first and last words, leaving the middle one little more than an aspiration.
	Like all its compeers which had been extensively popular, it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245"></a>was applicable to almost every variety of circumstance. The lovers
	of a plain answer to a plain question did not like it at all. Insolence
	made use of it to give offence; ignorance to avoid exposing itself;
	and waggery to create laughter. Every new comer into an alehouse
	tap-room was asked unceremoniously, “<em>Who are you?</em>” and if he
	looked foolish, scratched his head, and did not know what to reply,
	shouts of boisterous merriment resounded on every side. An authoritative
	disputant was not unfrequently put down, and presumption
	of every kind checked by the same query. When its popularity was
	at its height, a gentleman, feeling the hand of a thief in his pocket,
	turned suddenly round and caught him in the act, exclaiming, “<em>Who
	are you?</em>” The mob which gathered round applauded to the very echo,
	and thought it the most capital joke they had ever heard, the very
	acmé of wit, the very essence of humour. Another circumstance of
	a similar kind gave an additional fillip to the phrase, and infused new
	life and vigour into it just as it was dying away. The scene occurred
	in the chief criminal court of the kingdom. A prisoner stood at the
	bar; the offence with which he had been charged was clearly proved
	against him; his counsel had been heard, not in his defence, but in
	extenuation, insisting upon his previous good life and character as
	reasons for the lenity of the court. “And where are your witnesses?”
	inquired the learned judge who presided. “Please you, my lord, I
	knows the prisoner at the bar, and a more honester feller never
	breathed,” said a rough voice in the gallery. The officers of the court
	looked aghast, and the strangers tittered with ill-suppressed laughter.
	“<em>Who are you?</em>” said the judge, looking suddenly up, but with imperturbable
	gravity. The court was convulsed; the titter broke out
	into a laugh; and it was several minutes before silence and decorum
	could be restored. When the ushers recovered their self-possession,
	they made diligent search for the profane transgressor; but he was
	not to be found. Nobody knew him; nobody had seen him. After
	a while the business of the court again proceeded. The next prisoner
	brought up for trial augured favourably of his prospects when he
	learned that the solemn lips of the representative of justice had uttered
	the popular phrase as if he felt and appreciated it. There was
	no fear that such a judge would use undue severity. His heart was
	with the people; he understood their language and their manners,
	and would make allowances for the temptations which drove them
	into crime. So thought many of the prisoners, if we may infer it
	from the fact that the learned judge suddenly acquired an immense
	increase of popularity. The praise of his wit was in every mouth,
	and “<em>Who are you?</em>” renewed its lease, and remained in possession
	of public favour for another term in consequence.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246"></a>But it must not be supposed that there were no interregna between
	the dominion of one slang phrase and another. They did not arise in
	one long line of unbroken succession, but shared with song the possession
	of popular favour. Thus, when the people were in the mood
	for music, slang advanced its claims to no purpose; and when they
	were inclined for slang, the sweet voice of music wooed them in vain.
	About thirty years ago London resounded with one chorus, with the
	love of which every body seemed to be smitten. Girls and boys,
	young men and old, maidens and wives and widows, were all alike
	musical. There was an absolute mania for singing; and the worst of
	it was, that, like good Father Philip in the romance of <cite>The Monastery</cite>,
	they seemed utterly unable to change their tune. “Cherry ripe!”
	“Cherry ripe!” was the universal cry of all the idle in the town.
	Every unmelodious voice gave utterance to it; every crazy fiddle,
	every cracked flute, every wheezy pipe, every street-organ was heard
	in the same strain, until studious and quiet men stopped their ears
	in desperation, or fled miles away into the fields or woodlands to be
	at peace. This plague lasted for a twelvemonth, until the very name
	of cherries became an abomination in the land. At last the excitement
	wore itself away, and the tide of favour set in a new direction.
	Whether it was another song or a slang phrase is difficult to determine
	at this distance of time; but certain it is, that very shortly
	afterwards people went mad upon a dramatic subject, and nothing
	was to be heard of but “<em>Tommy and Jerry</em>.” Verbal wit had amused
	the multitude long enough, and they became more practical in their
	recreation. Every youth on the town was seized with the fierce desire
	of distinguishing himself by knocking down the “<em>charlies</em>,” being
	locked up all night in a watch-house, or kicking up a row among
	loose women and blackguard men in the low dens of St. Giles’s. Imitative
	boys vied with their elders in similar exploits, until this unworthy
	passion (for such it was) had lasted, like other follies, its
	appointed time, and the town became merry after another fashion.
	It was next thought the height of vulgar wit to answer all questions
	by placing the point of the thumb upon the tip of the nose, and
	twirling the fingers in the air. If one man wished to insult or annoy
	another, he had only to make use of this cabalistic sign in his face,
	and his object was accomplished. At every street-corner where a
	group was assembled, the spectator who was curious enough to observe
	their movements would be sure to see the fingers of some of
	them at their noses, either as a mark of incredulity, surprise, refusal,
	or mockery, before he had watched two minutes. There is some
	remnant of this absurd custom to be seen to this day; but it is thought
	low even among the vulgar.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247"></a>About sixteen years ago, London became again most preposterously
	musical. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</em> wore itself hoarse by singing the praises of
	“The Sea, the Sea!” If a stranger (and a philosopher) had walked
	through London, and listened to the universal chorus, he might have
	constructed a very pretty theory upon the love of the English for the
	sea-service, and our acknowledged superiority over all other nations
	upon that element. “No wonder,” he might have said, “that this
	people is invincible upon the ocean. The love of it mixes with their
	daily thoughts; they celebrate it even in the market-place; their
	street-minstrels excite charity by it; and high and low, young and
	old, male and female, chant <em>lo pæans</em> in its praise. Love is not
	honoured in the national songs of this warlike race—Bacchus is no god
	to them; they are men of sterner mould, and think only of ‘the Sea,
	the Sea!’ and the means of conquering upon it.”</p>

	<p>Such would, doubtless, have been his impression if he had taken
	the evidence only of his ears. Alas, in those days for the refined ears
	that <em>were</em> musical! great was their torture when discord, with its
	thousand diversities of tone, struck up this appalling anthem—there
	was no escape from it. The migratory minstrels of Savoy caught the
	strain, and pealed it down the long vistas of quiet streets, till their
	innermost and snuggest apartments re-echoed with the sound. Men
	were obliged to endure this crying evil for full six months, wearied
	to desperation, and made <em>sea</em>-sick on the dry land.</p>

	<p>Several other songs sprang up in due succession, afterwards, but
	none of them, with the exception of one, entitled “All round my
	Hat,” enjoyed any extraordinary share of favour, until an American
	actor introduced a vile song called “Jim Crow.” The singer sang his
	verses in appropriate costume, with grotesque gesticulations, and a
	sudden whirl of his body at the close of each verse. It took the taste
	of the town immediately, and for months the ears of orderly people
	were stunned by the senseless chorus—</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Turn about and wheel about,</p>
		<p class="i2">And do just so—</p>
		<p>Turn about and wheel about,</p>
		<p class="i2">And jump, Jim Crow!”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">Street-minstrels blackened their faces in order to give proper effect to
	the verses; and fatherless urchins, who had to choose between thieving
	and singing for their livelihood, took the latter course, as likely
	to be the more profitable, as long as the public taste remained in that
	direction. The uncouth dance, its accompaniment, might be seen in
	its full perfection on market nights in any great thoroughfare; and
	the words of the song might be heard, piercing above all the din and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248"></a>buzz of the ever-moving multitude. He, the calm observer, who
	during the hey-day popularity of this doggrel,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i16">“Sate beside the public way,</p>
		<p>Thick strewn with summer dust, and saw the stream</p>
		<p>Of people there was hurrying to and fro,</p>
		<p>Numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">might have exclaimed with Shelley, that</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<p>“The million, with fierce song and maniac dance,</p>
		<p>Did rage around.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">The philosophic theorist we have already supposed soliloquising
	upon the English character, and forming his opinion of it from
	their exceeding love for a sea-song, might, if he had again dropped
	suddenly into London, have formed another very plausible theory to
	account for our unremitting efforts for the abolition of the slave-trade.
	“Benevolent people!” he might have said, “how unbounded are
	your sympathies! Your unhappy brethren of Africa, differing from
	you only in the colour of their skins, are so dear to you, and you begrudge
	so little the twenty millions you have paid on their behalf,
	that you love to have a memento of them continually in your sight.
	Jim Crow is the representative of that injured race, and as such is
	the idol of your populace! See how they all sing his praises! how
	they imitate his peculiarities! how they repeat his name in their
	moments of leisure and relaxation! They even carve images of him
	to adorn their hearths, that his cause and his sufferings may never
	be forgotten! Oh, philanthropic England! oh, vanguard of civilisation!”</p>
	
	<p>Such are a few of the peculiarities of the London multitude, when
	no riot, no execution, no murder, no balloon, disturbs the even current
	of their thoughts. These are the whimsies of the mass—the
	harmless follies by which they unconsciously endeavour to lighten
	the load of care which presses upon their existence. The wise man,
	even though he smile at them, will not altogether withhold his sympathy,
	and will say, “Let them enjoy their slang phrases and their
	choruses if they will; and if they cannot be happy, at least let them
	be merry.” To the Englishman, as well as to the Frenchman of whom
	Beranger sings, there may be some comfort in so small a thing as a
	song, and we may own with him that</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Whether</span> it be that the multitude, feeling the pangs of poverty,
	sympathise with the daring and ingenious depredators who take away
	the rich man’s superfluity, or whether it be the interest that mankind
	in general feel for the records of perilous adventure, it is certain that
	the populace of all countries look with admiration upon great and
	successful thieves. Perhaps both these causes combine to invest
	their career with charms in the popular eye. Almost every country
	<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"></a>in Europe has its traditional thief, whose exploits are recorded with
	all the graces of poetry, and whose trespasses</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i16">“Are cited up in rhymes,</p>
		<p>And sung by children in succeeding tunes.”<a href="#fn45" id="fnm45" title="Shakspeare’s..." class="fnmarker">45</a></p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Those travellers who have made national manners and characteristics
	their peculiar study, have often observed and remarked upon
	this feeling. The learned Abbé le Blanc, who resided for some time
	in England at the commencement of the eighteenth century, says, in
	his amusing letters on the English and French nations, that he continually
	met with Englishmen who were not less vain in boasting of
	the success of their highwaymen than of the bravery of their troops.
	Tales of their address, their cunning, or their generosity, were in the
	mouths of every body, and a noted thief was a kind of hero in high
	repute. He adds that the mob, in all countries, being easily moved,
	look in general with concern upon criminals going to the gallows;
	but an English mob looked upon such scenes with extraordinary interest:
	they delighted to see them go through their last trials with
	resolution, and applauded those who were insensible enough to die
	as they had lived, braving the justice both of God and men: such, he
	might have added, as the noted robber Macpherson, of whom the old
	ballad says:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,</p>
		<p class="i2">Sae dauntingly gaed he:</p>
		<p>He played a spring, and danced it round</p>
		<p class="i2">Beneath the gallows tree.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Among these traditional thieves the most noted in England, or
	perhaps in any country, is Robin Hood, a name which popular affection
	has encircled with a peculiar halo. “He robbed the rich to give
	to the poor;” and his reward has been an immortality of fame, a
	tithe of which would be thought more than sufficient to recompense
	a benefactor of his species. Romance and poetry have been emulous
	to make him all their own; and the forest of Sherwood, in which he
	roamed with his merry men, armed with their long bows, and clad
	in Lincoln green, has become the resort of pilgrims, and a classic spot
	sacred to his memory. The few virtues he had, which would have ensured
	him no praise if he had been an honest man, have been blazoned
	forth by popular renown during seven successive centuries, and will
	never be forgotten while the English tongue endures. His charity to
	the poor, and his gallantry and respect for women, have made him the
	pre-eminent thief of all the world.</p>

	<p>Among English thieves of a later date, who has not heard of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"></a>Claude Duval, Dick Turpin, Jonathan Wild, and Jack Sheppard,
	those knights of the road and of the town, whose peculiar chivalry
	formed at once the dread and the delight of England during the
	eighteenth century? Turpin’s fame is unknown to no portion of the
	male population of England after they have attained the age of ten.
	His wondrous ride from London to York has endeared him to the
	imagination of millions; his cruelty in placing an old woman upon a fire,
	to force her to tell him where she had hidden her money, is regarded
	as a good joke; and his proud bearing upon the scaffold is looked
	upon as a virtuous action. The Abbé le Blanc, writing in 1737, says
	he was continually entertained with stories of Turpin—how, when
	he robbed gentlemen, he would generously leave them enough to continue
	their journey, and exact a pledge from them never to inform
	against him, and how scrupulous such gentlemen were in keeping
	their word. He was one day told a story with which the relator was
	in the highest degree delighted. Turpin, or some other noted robber,
	stopped a man whom he knew to be very rich, with the usual salutation—“Your
	money or your life!” but not finding more than five
	or six guineas about him, he took the liberty of entreating him, in
	the most affable manner, never to come out so ill provided; adding
	that, if he fell in with him, and he had no more than such a paltry
	sum, he would give him a good licking. Another story, told by one
	of Turpin’s admirers, was of a robbery he had committed upon a
	Mr. C. near Cambridge. He took from this gentleman his watch,
	his snuff-box, and all his money but two shillings, and, before he left
	him, required his word of honour that he would not cause him to be
	pursued or brought before a justice. The promise being given, they
	both parted very courteously. They afterwards met at Newmarket,
	and renewed their acquaintance. Mr. C. kept his word religiously;
	he not only refrained from giving Turpin into custody, but made a
	boast that he had fairly won some of his money back again in an
	honest way. Turpin offered to bet with him on some favourite horse,
	and Mr. C. accepted the wager with as good a grace as he could have
	done from the best gentleman in England. Turpin lost his bet and
	paid it immediately, and was so smitten with the generous behaviour
	of Mr. C., that he told him how deeply he regretted that the trifling
	affair which had happened between them did not permit them to
	drink together. The narrator of this anecdote was quite proud that
	England was the birthplace of such a highwayman.<a href="#fn46" id="fnm46" title="The Abbé..." class="fnmarker">46</a></p>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252"></a>Not less familiar to the people of England is the career of Jack
	Sheppard, as brutal a ruffian as ever disgraced his country, but who
	has claims upon the popular admiration which are very generally
	acknowledged. He did not, like Robin Hood, plunder the rich to relieve
	the poor, nor rob with an uncouth sort of courtesy, like Turpin;
	but he escaped from Newgate with the fetters on his limbs. This
	achievement, more than once repeated, has encircled his felon brow
	with the wreath of immortality, and made him quite a pattern thief
	among the populace. He was no more than twenty-three years of age
	at the time of his execution, and he died much pitied by the crowd.
	His adventures were the sole topics of conversation for months; the
	print-shops were filled with his effigies, and a fine painting of him
	was made by Sir Richard Thornhill. The following complimentary
	verses to the artist appeared in the <cite>British Journal</cite> of November 28th,
	1724:</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>“Thornhill! ’tis thine to gild with fame</p>
			<p>Th’ obscure, and raise the humble name;</p>
			<p>To make the form elude the grave,</p>
			<p>And Sheppard from oblivion save!</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>Apelles Alexander drew—</p>
			<p>Cæsar is to Aurelius due;</p>
			<p>Cromwell in Lilly’s works doth shine,</p>
			<p>And Sheppard, Thornhill, lives in thine!”</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>This was a very equivocal sort of compliment, and might have
	meant, that if Apelles were worthy to paint a monarch, Thornhill
	was worthy to paint a thief. But the artist did not view it in that
	light, nor did the public; for they considered the verses to be very
	neat, pointed, and flattering. So high was Jack’s fame, that he was
	thought a very fit subject for the stage; and a pantomime entertainment,
	called “<cite>Harlequin Jack Sheppard</cite>,” was devised by one Thurmond,
	and brought out with considerable success at Drury Lane
	<a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"></a>Theatre. All the scenes were painted from nature, including the
	public-house that the robber frequented in Clare Market, and the
	condemned cell from which he had made his escape in Newgate.<a href="#fn47" id="fnm47" title="Since the publication..." class="fnmarker">47</a></p>

	<p>The Rev. Mr. Villette, the editor of the <cite>Annals of Newgate</cite>, published
	in 1754, relates a curious sermon, which he says a friend of
	his heard delivered by a street-preacher about the time of Jack’s execution.
	The orator, after animadverting on the great care men took
	of their bodies, and the little care they bestowed upon their souls,
	continued as follows, by way of exemplifying the position:—“We
	have a remarkable instance of this in a notorious malefactor, well
	<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"></a>known by the name of Jack Sheppard. What amazing difficulties
	has he overcome! what astonishing things has he performed! and all
	for the sake of a stinking, miserable carcass, hardly worth the hanging!
	How dexterously did he pick the chain of his padlock with a
	crooked nail! how manfully he burst his fetters asunder, climb up
	the chimney, wrench out an iron bar, break his way through a stone
	wall, make the strong door of a dark entry fly before him, till he got
	upon the leads of the prison, then, fixing a blanket to the wall with
	a spike, he stole out of the chapel! How intrepidly did he descend
	to the top of the turner’s house! how cautiously pass down the stair,
	and make his escape to the street-door!</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Oh, that ye were all like Jack Sheppard! Mistake me not, my
		brethren—I don’t mean in a carnal, but in a spiritual sense; for I
		propose to spiritualise these things. What a shame it would be if
		we should not think it worth our while to take as much pains, and
		employ as many deep thoughts to save our souls as he has done to
		preserve his body!</p>

		<p>“Let me exhort ye, then, to open the locks of your hearts with
		the nail of repentance! Burst asunder the fetters of your beloved
		lusts, mount the chimney of hope, take from thence the bar of good
		resolution, break through the stone wall of despair, and all the
		strongholds in the dark entry of the valley of the shadow of death!
		Raise yourselves to the leads of divine meditation, fix the blanket of
		faith with the spike of the Church, let yourselves down to the turner’s
		house of resignation, and descend the stairs of humility! So shall
		you come to the door of deliverance from the prison of iniquity, and
		escape the clutches of that old executioner the devil!”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Jonathan Wild, whose name has been immortalised by Fielding,
	was no favourite with the people. He had none of the virtues which,
	combined with crimes, make up the character of the great thief. He
	was a pitiful fellow, who informed against his comrades, and was
	afraid of death. This meanness was not to be forgiven by the crowd;
	and they pelted him with dirt and stones on his way to Tyburn, and
	expressed their contempt by every possible means. How different
	was their conduct to Turpin and Jack Sheppard, who died in their
	neatest attire, with nosegays in their button-holes, and with the courage
	that a crowd expects. It was anticipated that the body of Turpin
	would have been delivered up to the surgeons for dissection; and
	the people seeing some men very busily employed in removing it, suddenly
	set upon them, rescued the body, bore it about the town in
	triumph, and then buried it in a very deep grave, filled with quicklime,
	to hasten the progress of decomposition. They would not suffer
	the corpse of their hero—of the man who had ridden from London to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255"></a>York in four-and-twenty hours—to be mangled by the rude hands of
	unmannerly surgeons.</p>

	<p>The death of Claude Duval would appear to have been no less
	triumphant. Claude was a gentlemanly thief. According to Butler,
	in the famous ode to his memory, he</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Taught the wild Arabs of the road</p>
		<p>To rob in a more gentle mode;</p>
		<p>Take prizes more obligingly than those</p>
		<p>Who never had been bred <em>filous</em>;</p>
		<p>And how to hang in a more graceful fashion</p>
		<p>Than e’er was known before to the dull English nation.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">In fact, he was the pink of politeness, and his gallantry to the fair
	sex was proverbial. When he was caught at last, pent in “stone
	walls and chains and iron grates,” their grief was in proportion to
	his rare merits and his great fame. Butler says, that to his dungeon</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i10">“Came ladies from all parts,</p>
		<p>To offer up close prisoners their hearts.</p>
		<p>Which he received as tribute due—</p>
		<p class="poetry_break">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
		<p>Never did bold knight to relieve</p>
		<p>Distressed dames, such dreadful feats achieve,</p>
		<p>As feeble damsels for his sake</p>
		<p>Would have been proud to undertake,</p>
		<p>And, bravely ambitious to redeem</p>
		<p>The world’s loss and their own,</p>
		<p>Strove who should have the honour to lay down,</p>
		<p>And change a life with him.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>Among the noted thieves of France, there is none to compare with
	the famous Aimerigot Têtenoire, who flourished in the reign of Charles
	VI. This fellow was at the head of four or five hundred men, and
	possessed two very strong castles in Limousin and Auvergne. There
	was a good deal of the feudal baron about him, although he possessed
	no revenues but such as the road afforded him. At his death he left
	a singular will. “I give and bequeath,” said the robber, “one thousand
	five hundred francs to St. George’s Chapel, for such repairs as it
	may need; to my sweet girl, who so loyally loved me, I give two
	thousand five hundred; and the surplus I give to my companions. I
	hope they will all live as brothers, and divide it amicably among
	them. If they cannot agree, and the devil of contention gets among
	them, it is no fault of mine; and I advise them to get a good strong
	sharp axe, and break open my strong box. Let them scramble for
	what it contains, and the devil seize the hindmost.” The people of
	Auvergne still recount with admiration the daring feats of this brigand.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256"></a>Of later years, the French thieves have been such unmitigated
	scoundrels as to have left but little room for popular admiration. The
	famous Cartouche, whose name has become synonymous with ruffian
	in their language, had none of the generosity, courtesy, and devoted
	bravery which are so requisite to make a robber-hero. He was born
	at Paris, towards the end of the seventeenth century, and broken alive
	on the wheel in November 1727. He was, however, sufficiently popular
	to have been pitied at his death, and afterwards to have formed
	the subject of a much-admired drama, which bore his name, and was
	played with great success in all the theatres of France during the
	years 1734, 5, and 6. In our own day the French have been more
	fortunate in a robber; Vidocq bids fair to rival the fame of Turpin
	and Jack Sheppard. Already he has become the hero of many an
	apocryphal tale—already his compatriots boast of his manifold achievements,
	and express their doubts whether any other country in Europe
	could produce a thief so clever, so accomplished, so gentlemanly, as
	Vidocq.</p>

	<p>Germany has its Schinderhannes, Hungary its Schubry, and Italy
	and Spain a whole host of brigands, whose names and exploits are
	familiar as household words in the mouths of the children and populace
	of those countries.</p>

	<p>The Italian banditti are renowned over the world; and many of
	them are not only very religious (after a fashion) but very charitable.
	Charity from such a source is so unexpected, that the people doat
	upon them for it. One of them, when he fell into the hands of the
	police, exclaimed, as they led him away, “Ho fatto più carità!”—“I
	have given away more in charity than any three convents in these
	provinces.” And the fellow spoke truth.</p>

	<p>In Lombardy, the people cherish the memory of two notorious
	robbers, who flourished about two centuries ago under the Spanish
	government. Their story, according to Macfarlane, is contained in
	a little book well known to all the children of the province, and read
	by them with much more gusto than their Bibles.</p>

	<p>Schinderhannes, the robber of the Rhine, is a great favourite on
	the banks of the river which he so long kept in awe. Many amusing
	stories are related by the peasantry<a href="#fn48" id="fnm48" title="For a full account..." class="fnmarker">48</a> of the scurvy tricks he played
	off upon rich Jews, or too-presuming officers of justice—of his princely
	generosity, and undaunted courage. In short, they are proud of him,
	and would no more consent to have the memory of his achievements
	dissociated from their river than they would have the rock of Ehrenbreitstein
	blown to atoms by gunpowder.</p>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257"></a>There is another robber-hero, of whose character and exploits the
	people of Germany speak admiringly. Mausch Nadel was captain of
	a considerable band that infested the Rhine, Switzerland, Alsatia,
	and Lorraine, during the years 1824, 5, and 6. Like Jack Sheppard,
	he endeared himself to the populace by his most hazardous escape
	from prison. Being confined at Bremen, in a dungeon on the third
	story of the prison of that town, he contrived to let himself down
	without exciting the vigilance of the sentinels, and to swim across
	the Weser, though heavily laden with irons. When about half-way
	over, he was espied by a sentinel, who fired at him, and shot him in
	the calf of the leg: but the undaunted robber struck out manfully,
	reached the shore, and was out of sight before the officers of justice
	could get ready their boats to follow him. He was captured again
	in 1826, tried at Mayence, and sentenced to death. He was a tall,
	strong, handsome man, and his fate, villain as he was, excited much
	sympathy all over Germany. The ladies especially were loud in their
	regret that nothing could be done to save a hero so good-looking,
	and of adventures so romantic, from the knife of the headsman.</p>

	<p>Mr. Charles Macfarlane, in speaking of Italian banditti, remarks,
	that the abuses of the Catholic religion, with its confessions and absolutions,
	have tended to promote crime of this description. But he adds
	more truly, that priests and monks have not done half the mischief
	which has been perpetrated by ballad-mongers and story-tellers. If he
	had said playwrights also, the list would have been complete. In fact,
	the theatre, which can only expect to prosper, in a pecuniary sense,
	by pandering to the tastes of the people, continually recurs to the
	annals of thieves and banditti for its most favourite heroes. These
	theatrical robbers, with their picturesque attire, wild haunts, jolly,
	reckless, devil-may-care manners, take a wonderful hold upon the
	imagination, and whatever their advocates may say to the contrary,
	exercise a very pernicious influence upon public morals. In the Memoirs
	of the Duke of Guise upon the Revolution of Naples in 1647
	and 1648, it is stated, that the manners, dress, and mode of life of
	the Neapolitan banditti were rendered so captivating upon the stage,
	that the authorities found it absolutely necessary to forbid the representation
	of dramas in which they figured, and even to prohibit their
	costume at the masquerades. So numerous were the banditti at this
	time, that the duke found no difficulty in raising an army of them,
	to aid him in his endeavours to seize on the throne of Naples. He
	thus describes them:<a href="#fn49" id="fnm49" title="See also..." class="fnmarker">49</a> “They were three thousand five hundred men,
	of whom the oldest came short of five-and-forty years, and the youngest
	was above twenty. They were all tall and well made, with long black
	<a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258"></a>hair, for the most part curled; coats of black Spanish leather, with
	sleeves of velvet, or cloth of gold; cloth breeches with gold lace, most
	of them scarlet; girdles of velvet, laced with gold, with two pistols
	on each side; a cutlass hanging at a belt, suitably trimmed, three
	fingers broad and two feet long; a hawking-bag at their girdle, and
	a powder-flask hung about their neck with a great silk riband. Some
	of them carried firelocks, and others blunderbusses; they had all
	good shoes, with silk stockings, and every one a cap of cloth of gold,
	or cloth of silver, of different colours, on his head, which was very
	delightful to the eye.”</p>
	
	<p><cite>The Beggar’s Opera</cite>, in our own country, is another instance of
	the admiration that thieves excite upon the stage. Of the extraordinary
	success of this piece, when first produced, the following account
	is given in the notes to <cite>The Dunciad</cite>, and quoted by Johnson in his
	<cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>: “This piece was received with greater applause
	than was ever known. Besides being acted in London sixty-three
	days without interruption, and renewed the next season with equal
	applause, it spread into all the great towns of England; was played
	in many places to the thirtieth and fortieth time; at Bath and
	Bristol, &amp;c. fifty. It made its progress into Wales, Scotland, and
	Ireland, where it was performed twenty-four days successively. The
	ladies carried about with them the favourite songs of it in fans, and
	houses were furnished with it in screens. The fame of it was not confined
	to the author only. The person who acted Polly, till then
	obscure, became all at once the favourite of the town;<a href="#fn50" id="fnm50" title="Lavinia Fenton..." class="fnmarker">50</a> her pictures
	were engraved and sold in great numbers; her life written, books of
	letters and verses to her published, and pamphlets made even of her
	sayings and jests. Furthermore, it drove out of England, for that
	season, the Italian Opera, which had carried all before it for ten years.”
	Dr. Johnson, in his life of the author, says, that Herring, afterwards
	Archbishop of Canterbury, censured the opera, as giving encouragement,
	not only to vice, but to crimes, by making the highwayman
	the hero, and dismissing him at last unpunished; and adds, that it
	was even said, that after the exhibition the gangs of robbers were
	evidently multiplied. The Doctor doubts the assertion, giving as his
	reason that highwaymen and housebreakers seldom frequent the playhouse,
	and that it was not possible for any one to imagine that he
	might rob with safety, because he saw Macheath reprieved upon the
	stage. But if Johnson had wished to be convinced, he might very
	easily have discovered that highwaymen and housebreakers did frequent
	the theatre, and that nothing was more probable than that a
	laughable representation of successful villany should induce the young
	<a class="pagenum" id="page259" title="259"></a>and the already vicious to imitate it. Besides, there is the weighty
	authority of Sir John Fielding, the chief magistrate of Bow Street,
	who asserted positively, and proved his assertion by the records of his
	office, that the number of thieves was greatly increased at the time
	when that opera was so popular.</p>
	
	<p>We have another instance of the same result much nearer our own
	times. Schiller’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Räuber</cite>, that wonderful play, written by a green
	youth, perverted the taste and imagination of all the young men in
	Germany. An accomplished critic of our own country (Hazlitt),
	speaking of this play, says it was the first he ever read, and such was
	the effect it produced on him, that “it stunned him, like a blow.”
	After the lapse of five-and-twenty years, he could not forget it; it
	was still, to use his own words, “an old dweller in the chambers of
	his brain,” and he had not even then recovered enough from it to describe
	how it was. The high-minded, metaphysical thief, its hero,
	was so warmly admired, that several raw students, longing to imitate
	a character they thought so noble, actually abandoned their homes
	and their colleges, and betook themselves to the forests and the wilds
	to levy contributions upon travellers. They thought they would, like
	Moor, plunder the rich, and deliver eloquent soliloquies to the setting
	sun or the rising moon; relieve the poor when they met them, and
	drink flasks of Rhenish with their free companions in rugged mountain
	passes, or in tents in the thicknesses of the forests. But a little experience
	wonderfully cooled their courage; they found that real, everyday
	robbers were very unlike the conventional banditti of the stage, and
	that three months in prison, with bread and water for their fare, and
	damp straw to lie upon, was very well to read about by their own firesides,
	but not very agreeable to undergo in their own proper persons.</p>

	<p>Lord Byron, with his soliloquising, high-souled thieves, has, in a
	slight degree, perverted the taste of the juvenile rhymers of his
	country. As yet, however, they have shewn more good sense than
	their fellows of Germany, and have not taken to the woods or the
	highways. Much as they admire Conrad the Corsair, they will not
	go to sea, and hoist the black flag for him. By words only, and not
	by deeds, they testify their admiration, and deluge the periodicals
	and music-shops of the land with verses describing pirates’ and bandits’
	brides, and robber adventures of every kind.</p>

	<p>But it is the playwright who does most harm; and Byron has
	fewer sins of this nature to answer for than Gay or Schiller. With
	the aid of scenery, fine dresses and music, and the very false notions
	they convey, they vitiate the public taste, not knowing,</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page260" title="260"></a>In the penny theatres that abound in the poor and populous districts
	of London, and which are chiefly frequented by striplings of
	idle and dissolute habits, tales of thieves and murderers are more
	admired, and draw more crowded audiences, than any other species
	of representation. There the footpad, the burglar, and the highwayman
	are portrayed in their natural colours, and give pleasant lessons
	in crime to their delighted listeners. There the deepest tragedy and
	the broadest farce are represented in the career of the murderer and
	the thief, and are applauded in proportion to their depth and their
	breadth. There, whenever a crime of unusual atrocity is committed,
	it is brought out afresh, with all its disgusting incidents copied from
	the life, for the amusement of those who will one day become its
	imitators.</p>

	<p>With the mere reader the case is widely different; and most people
	have a partiality for knowing the adventures of noted rogues. Even
	in fiction they are delightful: witness the eventful story of Gil Blas
	de Santillane, and of that great rascal Don Guzman d’Alfarache.
	Here there is no fear of imitation. Poets, too, without doing mischief,
	may sing of such heroes when they please, wakening our sympathies
	for the sad fate of Jemmy Dawson, or Gilderoy, or Macpherson
	the Dauntless; or celebrating in undying verse the wrongs and the
	revenge of the great thief of Scotland, Rob Roy. If, by the music of
	their sweet rhymes, they can convince the world that such heroes are
	but mistaken philosophers, born a few ages too late, and having both
	a theoretical and practical love for</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">the world may perhaps become wiser, and consent to some better
	distribution of its good things, by means of which thieves may become
	reconciled to the age, and the age to them. The probability, however,
	seems to be, that the charmers will charm in vain, charm they ever
	so wisely.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Most</span> writers, in accounting for the origin of duelling, derive it from
	the warlike habits of those barbarous nations who overran Europe in
	the early centuries of the Christian era, and who knew no mode so
	effectual for settling their differences as the point of the sword. In
	fact, duelling, taken in its primitive and broadest sense, means nothing
	more than combating, and is the universal resort of all wild
	animals, including man, to gain or defend their possessions, or avenge
	their insults. Two dogs who tear each other for a bone, or two bantams
	fighting on a dunghill for the love of some beautiful hen, or two
	fools on Wimbledon Common, shooting at each other to satisfy the
	laws of offended honour, stand on the same footing in this respect,
	and are each and all mere duellists. As civilisation advanced, the
	best-informed men naturally grew ashamed of such a mode of adjusting
	disputes, and the promulgation of some sort of laws for obtaining
	redress for injuries was the consequence. Still there were many cases
	<a class="pagenum" id="page262" title="262"></a>in which the allegations of an accuser could not be rebutted by any
	positive proof on the part of the accused; and in all these, which
	must have been exceedingly numerous in the early stages of European
	society, the combat was resorted to. From its decision there was no
	appeal. God was supposed to nerve the arm of the combatant whose
	cause was just, and to grant him the victory over his opponent. As
	Montesquieu well remarks,<a href="#fn51" id="fnm51" title="Esprit des Loix..." class="fnmarker">51</a> this belief was not unnatural among a
	people just emerging from barbarism. Their manners being wholly
	warlike, the man deficient in courage, the prime virtue of his fellows,
	was not unreasonably suspected of other vices besides cowardice,
	which is generally found to be co-existent with treachery. He, therefore,
	who shewed himself most valiant in the encounter was absolved
	by public opinion from any crime with which he might be charged.
	As a necessary consequence, society would have been reduced to its
	original elements, if the men of thought, as distinguished from the
	men of action, had not devised some means for taming the unruly
	passions of their fellows. With this view, governments commenced
	by restricting within the narrowest possible limits the cases in which
	it was lawful to prove or deny guilt by the single combat. By the
	law of Gondebaldus king of the Burgundians, passed in the year 501,
	the proof by combat was allowed in all legal proceedings in lieu of
	swearing. In the time of Charlemagne, the Burgundian practice had
	spread over the empire of the Francs, and not only the suitors for
	justice, but the witnesses, and even the judges, were obliged to defend
	their cause, their evidence, or their decision at the point of the
	sword. Louis the Debonnaire, his successor, endeavoured to remedy
	the growing evil by permitting the duel only in appeals of felony, in
	civil cases, or issue joined in a writ of right, and in cases of the court
	of chivalry, or attacks upon a man’s knighthood. None were exempt
	from these trials but women, the sick and the maimed, and persons
	under fifteen or above sixty years of age. Ecclesiastics were allowed
	to produce champions in their stead. This practice in the course of
	time extended to all trials of civil and criminal cases, which had to
	be decided by battle.</p>
	
	<p>The clergy, whose dominion was an intellectual one, never approved
	of a system of jurisprudence which tended so much to bring
	all things under the rule of the strongest arm. From the first they
	set their faces against duelling, and endeavoured, as far as the prejudices
	of their age would allow them, to curb the warlike spirit, so
	alien from the principles of religion. In the Council of Valentia,
	and afterwards in the Council of Trent, they excommunicated all persons
	engaged in duelling; and not only them, but even the assistants
	<a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263"></a>and spectators, declaring the custom to be hellish and detestable, and
	introduced by the devil for the destruction both of body and soul.
	They added also, that princes who connived at duels should be deprived
	of all temporal power, jurisdiction, and dominion over the
	places where they had permitted them to be fought. It will be seen
	hereafter that this clause only encouraged the practice which it was
	intended to prevent.</p>

	<p>But it was the blasphemous error of these early ages to expect
	that the Almighty, whenever he was called upon, would work a
	miracle in favour of a person unjustly accused. The priesthood, in
	condemning the duel, did not condemn the principle on which it was
	founded. They still encouraged the popular belief of divine interference
	in all the disputes or differences that might arise among
	nations or individuals. It was the very same principle that regulated
	the ordeals, which with all their influence they supported against the
	duel. By the former, the power of deciding the guilt or innocence
	was vested wholly in their hands; while by the latter they enjoyed
	no power or privilege at all. It is not to be wondered at that, for
	this reason, if for no other, they should have endeavoured to settle
	all differences by the peaceful mode. While that prevailed, they
	were, as they wished to be, the first party in the state; but while the
	strong arm of individual prowess was allowed to be the judge in all
	doubtful cases, their power and influence became secondary to those
	of the nobility.</p>

	<p>Thus it was not the mere hatred of bloodshed which induced them
	to launch the thunderbolts of excommunication against the combatants:
	it was a desire to retain the power, which, to do them justice,
	they were in those times the persons best qualified to wield. The
	germs of knowledge and civilisation lay within the bounds of their
	order; for they were the representatives of the intellectual, as the
	nobility were of the physical power of man. To centralise this power
	in the Church, and make it the judge of the last resort in all appeals,
	both in civil and criminal cases, they instituted five modes of trial,
	the management of which lay wholly in their hands. These were,
	the oath upon the evangelists; the ordeal of the cross and the fire
	ordeal, for persons in the higher ranks; the water ordeal, for the
	humbler classes; and, lastly, the <em>corsned</em>, or bread and cheese ordeal,
	for members of their own body.</p>

	<p>The oath upon the evangelists was taken in the following manner.
	The accused who was received to this proof, says Paul Hay, Count du
	Chastelet, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoirs of Bertrand du Guesclin</cite>, swore upon a copy
	of the New Testament, and on the relics of the holy martyrs, or on
	their tombs, that he was innocent of the crime imputed to him. He
	<a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264"></a>was also obliged to find twelve persons of acknowledged probity who
	should take oath at the same time that they believed him innocent.
	This mode of trial led to very great abuses, especially in cases of disputed
	inheritance, where the hardest swearer was certain of the victory.
	This abuse was one of the principal causes which led to the
	preference given to the trial by battle. It is not at all surprising that
	a feudal baron, or captain of the early ages, should have preferred the
	chances of a fair fight with his opponent to a mode by which firm
	perjury would always be successful.</p>

	<p>The trial by, or judgment of, the cross, which Charlemagne begged
	his sons to have recourse to, in case of disputes arising between them,
	was performed thus:—When a person accused of any crime had declared
	his innocence upon oath, and appealed to the cross for its
	judgment in his favour, he was brought into the church, before the
	altar. The priests previously prepared two sticks exactly like one
	another, upon one of which was carved a figure of the cross. They
	were both wrapped up with great care and many ceremonies, in a
	quantity of fine wool, and laid upon the altar, or on the relics of the
	saints. A solemn prayer was then offered up to God, that he would
	be pleased to discover, by the judgment of his holy cross, whether the
	accused person were innocent or guilty. A priest then approached
	the altar, and took up one of the sticks, and the assistants unswathed
	it reverently. If it was marked with the cross, the accused person
	was innocent; if unmarked, he was guilty. It would be unjust to
	assert, that the judgments thus delivered were, in all cases, erroneous;
	and it would be absurd to believe that they were left altogether
	to chance. Many true judgments were doubtless given, and,
	in all probability, most conscientiously; for we cannot but believe
	that the priests endeavoured beforehand to convince themselves by
	secret inquiry and a strict examination of the circumstances, whether
	the appellant were innocent or guilty, and that they took up the
	crossed or uncrossed stick accordingly. Although, to all other observers,
	the sticks, as enfolded in the wool, might appear exactly
	similar, those who enwrapped them could, without any difficulty, distinguish
	the one from the other.</p>

	<p>By the fire-ordeal the power of deciding was just as unequivocally
	left in their hands. It was generally believed that fire would not
	burn the innocent, and the clergy, of course, took care that the innocent,
	or such as it was their pleasure or interest to declare so, should
	be so warned before undergoing the ordeal, as to preserve themselves
	without any difficulty from the fire. One mode of ordeal was to place
	red-hot ploughshares on the ground at certain distances, and then,
	blindfolding the accused person, make him walk barefooted over
	<a class="pagenum" id="page265" title="265"></a>them. If he stepped regularly in the vacant spaces, avoiding the fire,
	he was adjudged innocent; if he burned himself, he was declared
	guilty. As none but the clergy interfered with the arrangement of
	the ploughshares, they could always calculate beforehand the result
	of the ordeal. To find a person guilty, they had only to place them
	at irregular distances, and the accused was sure to tread upon one of
	them. When Emma, the wife of King Ethelred, and mother of Edward
	the Confessor, was accused of a guilty familiarity with Alwyn
	Bishop of Winchester, she cleared her character in this manner. The
	reputation, not only of their order, but of a queen, being at stake, a
	verdict of guilty was not to be apprehended from any ploughshares
	which priests had the heating of. This ordeal was called the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicium
	Dei</em>, and sometimes the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulgaris Purgatio</em>, and might also be
	tried by several other methods. One was to hold in the hand, unhurt,
	a piece of red-hot iron, of the weight of one, two, or three pounds.
	When we read not only that men with hard hands, but women of
	softer and more delicate skin, could do this with impunity, we must
	be convinced that the hands were previously rubbed with some preservative,
	or that the apparently hot iron was merely cold iron painted
	red. Another mode was to plunge the naked arm into a caldron of
	boiling water. The priests then enveloped it in several folds of linen
	and flannel, and kept the patient confined within the church, and
	under their exclusive care, for three days. If, at the end of that
	time, the arm appeared without a scar, the innocence of the accused
	person was firmly established.<a href="#fn52" id="fnm52" title="Very similar to this..." class="fnmarker">52</a></p>

	<p>As regards the water-ordeal, the same trouble was not taken. It
	was a trial only for the poor and humble, and, whether they sank or
	<a class="pagenum" id="page266" title="266"></a>swam, was thought of very little consequence. Like the witches of
	more modern times, the accused were thrown into a pond or river;
	if they sank, and were drowned, their surviving friends had the consolation
	of knowing that they were innocent; if they swam, they
	were guilty. In either case society was rid of them.</p>

	<p>But of all the ordeals, that which the clergy reserved for themselves
	was the one least likely to cause any member of their corps to
	be declared guilty. The most culpable monster in existence came off
	clear when tried by this method. It was called the <em>Corsned</em>, and was
	thus performed. A piece of barley bread and a piece of cheese were
	laid upon the altar, and the accused priest, in his full canonicals, and
	surrounded by all the pompous adjuncts of Roman ceremony, pronounced
	certain conjurations, and prayed with great fervency for several
	minutes. The burden of the prayer was, that if he were guilty of
	the crime laid to his charge, God would send his angel Gabriel to stop
	his throat, that he might not be able to swallow the bread and cheese.
	There is no instance upon record of a priest having been choked in
	this manner.<a href="#fn53" id="fnm53" title="An ordeal very like this..." class="fnmarker">53</a></p>

	<p>When, under Pope Gregory VII., it was debated whether the Gregorian
	chant should be introduced into Castile, instead of the Musarabic,
	given by St. Isidore of Seville to the churches of that kingdom,
	very much ill feeling was excited. The churches refused to
	receive the novelty, and it was proposed that the affair should be
	decided by a battle between two champions, one chosen from each
	side. The clergy would not consent to a mode of settlement which
	they considered impious, but had no objection to try the merits of
	each chant by the fire-ordeal. A great fire was accordingly made,
	and a book of the Gregorian and one of the Musarabic chant were
	thrown into it, that the flames might decide which was most agreeable
	to God by refusing to burn it. Cardinal Baronius, who says he
	was an eye-witness of the miracle, relates, that the book of the Gregorian
	chant was no sooner laid upon the fire, than it leaped out
	uninjured, visibly, and with a great noise. Every one present thought
	that the saints had decided in favour of Pope Gregory. After a slight
	interval, the fire was extinguished; but, wonderful to relate! the
	other book of St. Isidore was found covered with ashes, but not injured
	<a class="pagenum" id="page267" title="267"></a>in the slightest degree. The flames had not even warmed it. Upon
	this it was resolved, that both were alike agreeable to God, and that
	they should be used by turns in all the churches of Seville.<a href="#fn54" id="fnm54" title="Histoire de Messire..." class="fnmarker">54</a></p>

	<p>If the ordeals had been confined to questions like this, the laity
	would have had little or no objection to them; but when they
	were introduced as decisive in all the disputes that might arise between
	man and man, the opposition of all those whose prime virtue
	was personal bravery, was necessarily excited. In fact, the nobility,
	from a very early period, began to look with jealous eyes upon them.
	They were not slow to perceive their true purport, which was no
	other than to make the Church the last court of appeal in all cases,
	both civil and criminal: and not only did the nobility prefer the
	ancient mode of single combat from this cause, in itself a sufficient
	one, but they clung to it because an acquittal gained by those displays
	of courage and address which the battle afforded, was more
	creditable in the eyes of their compeers, than one which it required
	but little or none of either to accomplish. To these causes may be
	added another, which was perhaps more potent than either in raising
	the credit of the judicial combat at the expense of the ordeal.
	The noble institution of chivalry was beginning to take root, and,
	notwithstanding the clamours of the clergy, war was made the sole
	business of life, and the only elegant pursuit of the aristocracy. The
	fine spirit of honour was introduced, any attack upon which was only
	to be avenged in the lists, within sight of applauding crowds, whose
	verdict of approbation was far more gratifying than the cold and
	formal acquittal of the ordeal. Lothaire, the son of Louis I., abolished
	that by fire and the trial of the cross within his dominions;
	but in England they were allowed so late as the time of Henry III.,
	in the early part of whose reign they were prohibited by an order of
	council. In the mean time, the Crusades had brought the institution
	of chivalry to the full height of perfection. The chivalric spirit
	soon achieved the downfall of the ordeal system, and established the
	judicial combat on a basis too firm to be shaken. It is true that with
	the fall of chivalry, as an institution, fell the tournament and the
	encounter in the lists; but the duel, their offspring, has survived to
	this day, defying the efforts of sages and philosophers to eradicate
	it. Among all the errors bequeathed to us by a barbarous age, it has
	proved the most pertinacious. It has put variance between men’s
	reason and their honour; put the man of sense on a level with the
	fool, and made thousands who condemn it submit to it or practise it.</p>

	<p>Those who are curious to see the manner in which these combats
	were regulated, may consult the learned Montesquieu, where they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268"></a>will find a copious summary of the code of ancient duelling.<a href="#fn55" id="fnm55" title="Esprit des Loix..." class="fnmarker">55</a> Truly
	does he remark, in speaking of the clearness and excellence of the
	arrangements, that, as there were many wise matters which were
	conducted in a very foolish manner, so there were many foolish matters
	conducted very wisely. No greater exemplification of it could
	be given than the wise and religious rules of the absurd and blasphemous
	trial by battle.</p>

	<p>In the ages that intervened between the Crusades and the new
	era that was opened out by the invention of gunpowder and printing,
	a more rational system of legislation took root. The inhabitants of
	cities, engaged in the pursuits of trade and industry, were content to
	acquiesce in the decisions of their judges and magistrates whenever
	any differences arose among them. Unlike the class above them,
	their habits and manners did not lead them to seek the battle-field
	on every slight occasion. A dispute as to the price of a sack of corn,
	a bale of broad-cloth, or a cow, could be more satisfactorily adjusted
	before the mayor or bailiff of their district. Even the martial knights
	and nobles, quarrelsome as they were, began to see that the trial by
	battle would lose its dignity and splendour if too frequently resorted
	to. Governments also shared this opinion, and on several occasions
	restricted the cases in which it was legal to proceed to this extremity.
	In France, before the time of Louis IX., duels were permitted only
	in cases of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</em>, <em>rape</em>, <em>incendiarism</em>, <em>assassination</em>, and <em>burglary</em>.
	Louis IX., by taking off all restriction, made them legal in
	civil cases. This was not found to work well, and, in 1303, Philip
	the Fair judged it necessary to confine them, in criminal matters, to
	state offences, rape, and incendiarism; and in civil cases, to questions
	of disputed inheritance. Knighthood was allowed to be the
	best judge of its own honour, and might defend or avenge it as often
	as occasion arose.</p>

	<p>Among the earliest duels upon record, is a very singular one that
	took place in the reign of Louis II. (<span class="small_all_caps">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 878). Ingelgerius count
	of Gastinois was one morning discovered by his countess dead in bed
	at her side. Gontran, a relation of the count, accused the countess
	of having murdered her husband, to whom, he asserted, she had long
	been unfaithful, and challenged her to produce a champion to do
	battle in her behalf, that he might establish her guilt by killing him.<a href="#fn56" id="fnm56" title="Mémoires de Brantôme touchant les Duels." class="fnmarker">56</a>
	All the friends and relatives of the countess believed in her innocence;
	but Gontran was so stout and bold and renowned a warrior that no
	one dared to meet him, for which, as Brantôme quaintly says, “mauvais
	et poltrons parens estaient.” The unhappy countess began to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269"></a>despair, when a champion suddenly appeared in the person of Ingelgerius
	count of Anjou, a boy of sixteen years of age, who had been
	held by the countess on the baptismal font, and received her husband’s
	name. He tenderly loved his godmother, and offered to do battle in
	her cause against any and every opponent. The king endeavoured
	to persuade the generous boy from his enterprise, urging the great
	strength, tried skill, and invincible courage of the challenger; but
	he persisted in his resolution, to the great sorrow of all the court,
	who said it was a cruel thing to permit so brave and beautiful a child
	to rush to such butchery and death.</p>

		<p class="caption">DUEL BETWEEN INGELGERIUS AND GONTRAN.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270"></a>When the lists were prepared, the countess duly acknowledged
	her champion, and the combatants commenced the onset. Gontran
	rode so fiercely at his antagonist, and hit him on the shield with such
	impetuosity, that he lost his own balance and rolled to the ground. The
	young count, as Gontran fell, passed his lance through his body, and
	then dismounting, cut off his head, which, Brantôme says, “he presented
	to the king, who received it most graciously, and was very
	joyful, as much so as if any one had made him a present of a city.”
	The innocence of the countess was then proclaimed with great rejoicings;
	and she kissed her godson, and wept over his neck with joy, in
	the presence of all the assembly.</p>

	<p>When the Earl of Essex was accused, by Robert de Montfort, before
	King Henry II., in 1162, of having traitorously suffered the royal
	standard of England to fall from his hands in a skirmish with the
	Welsh at Coleshill, five years previously, the latter offered to prove
	the truth of the charge by single combat. The Earl of Essex accepted
	the challenge, and the lists were prepared near Reading. An immense
	concourse of persons assembled to witness the battle. Essex at first
	fought stoutly, but, losing his temper and self-command, he gave an
	advantage to his opponent which soon decided the struggle. He was
	unhorsed, and so severely wounded, that all present thought he was
	dead. At the solicitation of his relatives, the monks of the Abbey of
	Reading were allowed to remove the body for interment, and Montfort
	was declared the victor. Essex, however, was not dead, but
	stunned only, and, under the care of the monks, recovered in a few
	weeks from his bodily injuries. The wounds of his mind were not
	so easily healed. Though a loyal and brave subject, the whole realm
	believed him a traitor and a coward because he had been vanquished.
	He could not brook to return to the world deprived of the good opinion
	of his fellows; he therefore made himself a monk, and passed
	the remainder of his days within the walls of the abbey.</p>

	<p>Du Chastelet relates a singular duel that was proposed in Spain.<a href="#fn57" id="fnm57" title="Histoire de Messire..." class="fnmarker">57</a>
	A Christian gentleman of Seville sent a challenge to a Moorish cavalier,
	offering to prove against him, with whatever weapons he might
	choose, that the religion of Jesus Christ was holy and divine, and that
	of Mahomet impious and damnable. The Spanish prelates did not
	choose that Christianity should be compromised within their jurisdiction
	by the result of any such combat; the Moorish cavalier might,
	perchance, have proved to be the stronger, and they commanded the
	knight, under pain of excommunication, to withdraw the challenge.</p>
	
	<p>The same author relates that, under Otho I., a question arose
	among jurisconsults, viz. whether grandchildren, who had lost their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page271" title="271"></a>father, should share equally with their uncles in the property of their
	grandfather, at the death of the latter. The difficulty of this question
	was found so insurmountable, that none of the lawyers of that
	day could resolve it. It was at last decreed that it should be decided
	by single combat. Two champions were accordingly chosen; one
	for, and the other against, the claims of the little ones. After a long
	struggle, the champion of the uncles was unhorsed and slain; and it
	was therefore decided that the right of the grandchildren was established,
	and that they should enjoy the same portion of their grandfather’s
	possessions that their father would have done had he been alive.</p>

	<p>Upon pretexts just as strange, and often more frivolous that these,
	duels continued to be fought in most of the countries of Europe during
	the whole of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. A memorable
	instance of the slightness of the pretext on which a man could be
	forced to fight a duel to the death, occurs in the Memoirs of the brave
	Constable, Du Guesclin. The advantage he had obtained, in a skirmish
	before Rennes, against William Brembre, an English captain, so preyed
	on the spirits of William Troussel, the chosen friend and companion
	of the latter, that nothing would satisfy him but a mortal combat
	with the Constable. The Duke of Lancaster, to whom Troussel applied
	for permission to fight the great Frenchman, forbade the battle,
	as not warranted by the circumstances. Troussel nevertheless burned
	with a fierce desire to cross his weapon with Du Guesclin, and sought
	every occasion to pick a quarrel with him. Having so good a will for
	it, of course he found a way. A relative of his had been taken prisoner
	by the Constable, in whose hands he remained till he was able
	to pay his ransom. Troussel resolved to make a quarrel out of this,
	and despatched a messenger to Du Guesclin, demanding the release
	of his prisoner, and offering a bond, at a distant date, for the payment
	of the ransom. Du Guesclin, who had received intimation of the
	hostile purposes of the Englishman, sent back word that he would
	not accept his bond, neither would he release his prisoner until the
	full amount of his ransom was paid. As soon as this answer was
	received, Troussel sent a challenge to the Constable, demanding reparation
	for the injury he had done his honour, by refusing his bond,
	and offering a mortal combat, to be fought three strokes with the
	lance, three with the sword, and three with the dagger. Du Guesclin,
	although ill in bed with the ague, accepted the challenge, and gave
	notice to the Marshal d’Andreghem, the king’s lieutenant-general in
	Lower Normandy, that he might fix the day and the place of combat.
	The marshal made all necessary arrangements, upon condition that
	he who was beaten should pay a hundred florins of gold to feast the
	nobles and gentlemen who were witnesses of the encounter.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272"></a>The Duke of Lancaster was very angry with his captain, and told
	him that it would be a shame to his knighthood and his nation if he
	forced on a combat with the brave Du Guesclin at a time when he
	was enfeebled by disease and stretched on the couch of suffering.
	Upon these representations, Troussel, ashamed of himself, sent notice
	to Du Guesclin that he was willing to postpone the duel until such
	time as he should be perfectly recovered. Du Guesclin replied, that
	he could not think of postponing the combat after all the nobility
	had received notice of it; that he had sufficient strength left not only
	to meet, but to conquer such an opponent as he was; and that if
	he did not make his appearance in the lists at the time appointed,
	he would publish him every where as a man unworthy to be called a
	knight, or to wear an honourable sword by his side. Troussel carried
	this haughty message to the Duke of Lancaster, who immediately
	gave permission for the battle.</p>

	<p>On the day appointed, the two combatants appeared in the lists,
	in the presence of several thousand spectators. Du Guesclin was
	attended by the flower of the French nobility, including the Marshal
	de Beaumanoir, Olivier de Mauny, Bertrand de Saint Pern, and the
	Viscount de la Bellière; while the Englishman appeared with no
	more than the customary retinue of two seconds, two squires, two
	coutilliers or daggermen, and two trumpeters. The first onset was
	unfavourable to the Constable. He received so heavy a blow on his
	shield-arm, that he fell forward to the left upon his horse’s neck; and
	being weakened by his fever, was nearly thrown to the ground. All
	his friends thought he could never recover himself, and began to deplore
	his ill fortune; but Du Guesclin collected his energies for a
	decisive effort, and at the second charge aimed a blow at the shoulder
	of his enemy, which felled him to the earth, mortally wounded. He
	then sprang from his horse, sword in hand, with the intention of cutting
	off the head of his fallen foe, when the Marshal d’Andreghem
	threw a golden wand into the arena as a signal that hostilities should
	cease. Du Guesclin was proclaimed the victor amid the joyous acclamations
	of the crowd, and retiring, left the field to the meaner combatants,
	who were afterwards to make sport for the people. Four
	English and as many French squires fought for some time with pointless
	lances, when the French gaining the advantage, the sports were
	declared at an end.</p>

	<p>In the time of Charles VI., about the beginning of the fifteenth
	century, a famous duel was ordered by the parliament of Paris. The
	Sieur de Carrouges being absent in the Holy Land, his lady was violated
	by the Sieur Legris. Carrouges, on his return, challenged Legris
	to mortal combat for the twofold crime of violation and slander,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273"></a>inasmuch as he had denied his guilt by asserting that the lady was a willing
	party. The lady’s asseverations of innocence were held to be no
	evidence by the parliament, and the duel was commanded, with all
	the ceremonies. “On the day appointed,” says Brantôme,<a href="#fn58" id="fnm58" title="Mémoires de Brantôme..." class="fnmarker">58</a> “the
	lady came to witness the spectacle in her chariot; but the king made
	her descend, judging her unworthy, because she was criminal in his
	eyes till her innocence was proved, and caused her to stand upon a
	scaffold to await the mercy of God and this judgment by the battle.
	After a short struggle, the Sieur de Carrouges overthrew his enemy,
	and made him confess both the rape and the slander. He was then
	taken to the gallows and hanged in the presence of the multitude;
	while the innocence of the lady was proclaimed by the heralds, and
	recognised by her husband, the king, and all the spectators.”</p>
	
	<p>Numerous battles of a similar description constantly took place,
	until the unfortunate issue of one encounter of the kind led the
	French king, Henry II., to declare solemnly that he would never
	again permit any such encounter, whether it related to a civil or criminal
	case, or the honour of a gentleman.</p>

	<p>This memorable combat was fought in the year 1547. François
	de Vivonne, lord of La Chataigneraie, and Guy de Chabot, lord of
	Jarnac, had been friends from their early youth, and were noted at
	the court of Francis I. for the gallantry of their bearing and the magnificence
	of their retinue. Chataigneraie, who knew that his friend’s
	means were not very ample, asked him one day in confidence how it
	was that he contrived to be so well provided? Jarnac replied, that
	his father had married a young and beautiful woman, who, loving the
	son far better than the sire, supplied him with as much money as he
	desired. La Chataigneraie betrayed the base secret to the dauphin,
	the dauphin to the king, the king to his courtiers, and the courtiers
	to all their acquaintance. In a short time it reached the ears of the
	old Lord de Jarnac, who immediately sent for his son, and demanded
	to know in what manner the report had originated, and whether he
	had been vile enough not only to carry on such a connexion, but to
	boast of it? De Jarnac indignantly denied that he had ever said so,
	or given reason to the world to say so, and requested his father to
	accompany him to court and confront him with his accuser, that he
	might see the manner in which he would confound him. They went
	accordingly; and the younger De Jarnac, entering a room where the
	dauphin, La Chataigneraie, and several courtiers were present, exclaimed
	aloud, “That whoever had asserted that he maintained a
	criminal connexion with his mother-in-law was a liar and a coward!”
	Every eye was turned to the dauphin and La Chataigneraie, when the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274"></a>latter stood forward and asserted, that De Jarnac had himself avowed
	that such was the fact, and he would extort from his lips another
	confession of it. A case like this could not be met or rebutted by
	any legal proof, and the royal council ordered that it should be decided
	by single combat. The king, however, set his face against the
	duel,<a href="#fn59" id="fnm59" title="Although Francis shewed himself..." class="fnmarker">59</a> and forbade them both, under pain of his high displeasure, to
	proceed any further in the matter. But Francis died in the following
	year, and the dauphin, now Henry II., who was himself compromised,
	resolved that the combat should take place.</p>	
	
	<p>The lists were prepared in the court-yard of the chateau of St.
	Germain-en-Laye, and the 10th of July, 1547, was appointed for the
	encounter. The cartels of the combatants, which are preserved in
	the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de Castelnau</cite>, were as follow:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“<em>Cartel of François de Vivonne, lord of la Chataigneraie</em>.</p>

		<p>“<span class="special_name">Sire</span>,</p>

		<p>“Having learned that Guy Chabot de Jarnac, being lately at
		Compiegne, asserted that whoever had said that he boasted of having
		criminal intercourse with his mother-in-law was wicked and a wretch,
		I, sire, with your good will and pleasure, do answer that he has
		wickedly lied, and will lie as many times as he denies having said
		that which I affirm he did say; for I repeat, that he told me several
		times, and boasted of it, that he had slept with his mother-in-law.</p>

		<p class="sign">“<span class="special_name">François de Vivonne</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>To this cartel De Jarnac replied:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“<span class="special_name">Sire</span>,</p>

		<p>“With your good will and permission, I say, that François
		de Vivonne has lied in the imputation which he has cast upon me,
		and of which I spoke to you at Compiegne. I therefore entreat
		you, sire, most humbly, that you be pleased to grant us a fair field,
		that we may fight this battle to the death.</p>

		<p class="sign">“<span class="special_name">Guy Chabot</span>.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>The preparations were conducted on a scale of the greatest magnificence,
	the king having intimated his intention of being present.
	La Chataigneraie made sure of the victory, and invited the king and
	a hundred and fifty of the principal personages of the court to sup
	with him in the evening, after the battle, in a splendid tent which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275"></a>he had prepared at the extremity of the lists. De Jarnac was not so
	confident, though perhaps more desperate. At noon, on the day appointed,
	the combatants met, and each took the customary oath that
	he bore no charms or amulets about him, or made use of any magic,
	to aid him against his antagonist. They then attacked each other,
	sword in hand. La Chataigneraie was a strong robust man, and over
	confident; De Jarnac was nimble, supple, and prepared for the worst.
	The combat lasted for some time doubtful, until De Jarnac, overpowered
	by the heavy blows of his opponent, covered his head with
	his shield, and, stooping down, endeavoured to make amends by his
	agility for his deficiency of strength. In this crouching posture he
	aimed two blows at the left thigh of La Chataigneraie, who had
	left it uncovered, that the motion of his leg might not be impeded.
	Each blow was successful, and, amid the astonishment of all the
	spectators, and to the great regret of the king, La Chataigneraie
	rolled over upon the sand. He seized his dagger, and made a last
	effort to strike De Jarnac: but he was unable to support himself,
	and fell powerless into the arms of the assistants. The officers now
	interfered, and De Jarnac being declared the victor, fell down upon
	his knees, uncovered his head, and, clasping his hands together,
	exclaimed: “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">O Domine, non sum dignus!</em>” La Chataigneraie was
	so mortified by the result of the encounter, that he resolutely
	refused to have his wounds dressed. He tore off the bandages which
	the surgeons applied, and expired two days afterwards. Ever since
	that time, any sly and unforeseen attack has been called by the
	French a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de Jarnac</em>. Henry was so grieved at the loss of his
	favourite, that he made the solemn oath already alluded to, that he
	would never again, so long as he lived, permit a duel. Some writers
	have asserted, and among others, Mezerai, that he issued a royal
	edict forbidding them. This has been doubted by others, and as
	there appears no registry of the edict in any of the courts, it seems
	most probable that it was never issued. This opinion is strengthened
	by the fact, that, two years afterwards, the council ordered another
	duel to be fought with similar forms, but with less magnificence,
	on account of the inferior rank of the combatants. It is not anywhere
	stated that Henry interfered to prevent it, notwithstanding
	his solemn oath; but that, on the contrary, he encouraged it, and
	appointed the Marshal de la Marque to see that it was conducted
	according to the rules of chivalry. The disputants were Fendille
	and D’Aguerre, two gentlemen of the household, who, quarrelling in
	the king’s chamber, had proceeded from words to blows. The council,
	being informed of the matter, decreed that it could only be decided
	in the lists. Marshal de la Marque, with the king’s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276"></a>permission, appointed the city of Sedan as the place of combat. Fendille,
	who was a bad swordsman, was anxious to avoid an encounter with
	D’Aguerre, who was one of the most expert men of the age; but the
	council authoritatively commanded that he should fight, or be degraded
	from all his honours. D’Aguerre appeared in the field attended
	by François de Vendôme, Count de Chartres, while Fendille
	was accompanied by the Duke of Nevers. Fendille appears to have
	been not only an inexpert swordsman, but a thorough coward; one
	who, like Cowley, might have heaped curses on the man,</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i4">“(Death’s factor sure), who brought</p>
		<p>Dire swords into this peaceful world.”</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="continued_paragraph">On the very first encounter he was thrown from his horse, and, confessing
	on the ground all that his victor required of him, slunk away
	ignominiously from the arena.</p>
	
	<p>One is tempted to look upon the death of Henry II. as a judgment
	upon him for his perjury in the matter of duelling. In a grand
	tournament instituted on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter,
	he broke several lances in encounters with some of the bravest
	knights of the time. Ambitious of still further renown, he would
	not rest satisfied until he had also engaged the young Count de Montgommeri.
	He received a wound in the eye from the lance of his antagonist,
	and died from its effects shortly afterwards, in the forty-first
	year of his age.</p>

	<p>In the succeeding reigns of Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III.,
	the practice of duelling increased to an alarming extent. Duels were
	not rare in the other countries of Europe at the same period; but in
	France they were so frequent, that historians, in speaking of that
	age, designate it as “l’époque de la fureur des duels.” The parliament
	of Paris endeavoured, as far as in its power lay, to discourage
	the practice. By a decree dated the 26th of June 1559, it declared
	all persons who should be present at duels, or aiding and abetting in
	them, to be rebels to the king, transgressors of the law, and disturbers
	of the public peace.</p>

	<p>When Henry III. was assassinated at St. Cloud in 1589, a young
	gentleman, named L’Isle-Marivaut, who had been much beloved by
	him, took his death so much to heart, that he resolved not to survive
	him. Not thinking suicide an honourable death, and wishing,
	as he said, to die gloriously in revenging his king and master, he
	publicly expressed his readiness to fight any body to the death, who
	should assert that Henry’s assassination was not a great misfortune
	to the community. Another youth, of a fiery temper and tried courage,
	named Marolles, took him at his word, and the day and place
	<a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277"></a>of the combat were forthwith appointed. When the hour had come,
	and all were ready, Marolles turned to his second, and asked whether
	his opponent had a casque or helmet only, or whether he wore a
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sallade</em>, or headpiece. Being answered a helmet only, he said gaily,
	“So much the better; for, sir my second, you shall repute me the
	wickedest man in all the world, if I do not thrust my lance right
	through the middle of his head and kill him.” Truth to say, he did
	so at the very first onset, and the unhappy L’Isle-Marivaut expired
	without a groan. Brantôme, who relates this story, adds, that the
	victor might have done as he pleased with the body, cut off the
	head, dragged it out of the camp, or exposed it upon an ass; but
	that being a wise and very courteous gentleman, he left it to the relatives
	of the deceased to be honourably buried, contenting himself
	with the glory of his triumph, by which he gained no little renown
	and honour among the ladies of Paris.</p>

		<p class="caption">HENRY IV.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>On the accession of Henry IV. that monarch determined to set his
	face against duelling; but such was the influence of early education
	and the prejudices of society upon him, that he never could find it in
	his heart to punish a man for this offence.
	He thought it tended to foster
	a warlike spirit among his people.
	When the chivalrous Créqui demanded
	his permission to fight Don Philippe
	de Savoire, he is reported to have said,
	“Go, and if I were not a king, I would
	be your second.” It is no wonder
	that when such was known to be the
	king’s disposition, his edicts attracted
	but small attention. A calculation
	was made by M. de Lomenie, in the
	year 1607, that since the accession of
	Henry, in 1589, no less than four
	thousand French gentlemen had lost
	their lives in these conflicts; which, for the eighteen years, would
	have been at the rate of four or five in a week, or eighteen per
	month! Sully, who reports this fact in his Memoirs, does not
	throw the slightest doubt upon its exactness; and adds, that it
	was chiefly owing to the facility and ill-advised good-nature of his
	royal master that the bad example had so empoisoned the court, the
	city, and the whole country. This wise minister devoted much of his
	time and attention to the subject; for the rage, he says, was such as
	to cause him a thousand pangs, and the king also. There was hardly
	a man moving in what was called good society, who had not been
	<a class="pagenum" id="page278" title="278"></a>engaged in a duel either as principal or second; and if there were
	such a man, his chief desire was to free himself from the imputation
	of non-duelling, by picking a quarrel with somebody. Sully constantly
	wrote letters to the king, in which he prayed him to renew
	the edicts against this barbarous custom, to aggravate the punishment
	against offenders, and never, in any instance, to grant a pardon,
	even to a person who had wounded another in a duel, much less to
	any one who had taken away life. He also advised, that some sort
	of tribunal, or court of honour, should be established, to take cognisance
	of injurious and slanderous language, and of all such matters as
	usually led to duels; and that the justice to be administered by this
	court should be sufficiently prompt and severe to appease the complainant,
	and make the offender repent of his aggression.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>Henry, being so warmly pressed by his friend and minister, called
	together an extraordinary council in the gallery of the palace of Fontainebleau,
	to take the matter into consideration. When all the
	members were assembled, his majesty requested that some person
	conversant with the subject would make a report to him on the origin,
	progress, and different forms of the duel. Sully complacently
	remarks, that none of the councillors gave the king any great reason
	to felicitate them on their erudition. In fact, they all remained
	silent. Sully held his peace with the rest; but he looked so
	<a class="pagenum" id="page279" title="279"></a>knowing, that the king turned towards him, and said:—“Great master!
	by your face I conjecture that you know more of this matter than
	you would have us believe. I pray you, and indeed I command, that
	you tell us what you think and what you know.” The coy minister
	refused, as he says, out of mere politeness to his more ignorant colleagues;
	but, being again pressed by the king, he entered into a history
	of duelling both in ancient and modern times. He has not preserved
	this history in his Memoirs; and, as none of the ministers or
	councillors present thought proper to do so, the world is deprived
	of a discourse which was, no doubt, a learned and remarkable one.
	The result was, that a royal edict was issued, which Sully lost no
	time in transmitting to the most distant provinces, with a distinct
	notification to all parties concerned that the king was in earnest, and
	would exert the full rigour of the law in punishment of the offenders.
	Sully himself does not inform us what were the provisions of the new
	law; but Father Matthias has been more explicit, and from him we
	learn, that the marshals of France were created judges of a court of
	chivalry, for the hearing of all causes wherein the honour of a noble
	or gentleman was concerned, and that such as resorted to duelling
	should be punished by death and confiscation of property, and that
	the seconds and assistants should lose their rank, dignity, or offices,
	and be banished from the court of their sovereign.<a href="#fn60" id="fnm60" title="Le Père Matthias..." class="fnmarker">60</a></p>
	
	<p>But so strong a hold had the education and prejudice of his age
	upon the mind of the king, that though his reason condemned, his
	sympathies approved the duel. Notwithstanding this threatened
	severity, the number of duels did not diminish, and the wise Sully
	had still to lament the prevalence of an evil which menaced society
	with utter disorganisation. In the succeeding reign the practice prevailed,
	if possible, to a still greater extent, until the Cardinal de
	Richelieu, better able to grapple with it than Sully had been, made
	some severe examples in the very highest classes. Lord Herbert, the
	English ambassador at the court of Louis XIII., repeats, in his letters,
	an observation that had been previously made in the reign of
	Henry IV., that it was rare to find a Frenchman moving in good
	society who had not killed his man in a duel. The Abbé Millot says
	of this period, that the duel madness made the most terrible ravages.
	Men had actually a frenzy for combating. Caprice and vanity, as
	well as the excitement of passion, imposed the necessity of fighting.
	Friends were obliged to enter into the quarrels of their friends, or be
	themselves called out for their refusal, and revenge became hereditary
	in many families. It was reckoned that in twenty years eight
	<a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280"></a>thousand letters of pardon had been issued to persons who had killed
	others in single combat.<a href="#fn61" id="fnm61" title="Elémens de l'Histoire de France..." class="fnmarker">61</a></p>

	<p>Other writers confirm this statement. Amelot de Houssaye, in
	his Memoirs, says, upon this subject, that duels were so common
	in the first years of the reign of Louis XIII., that the ordinary conversation
	of persons when they met in the morning was, “<em>Do you
	know who fought yesterday?</em>” and after dinner, “<em>Do you know who
	fought this morning?</em>” The most infamous duellist at that period
	was De Bouteville. It was not at all necessary to quarrel with this
	assassin, to be forced to fight a duel with him. When he heard that
	any one was very brave, he would go to him, and say, “<em>People tell me
	that you are brave; you and I must fight together!</em>” Every morning the
	most notorious bravos and duellists used to assemble at his house, to
	take a breakfast of bread and wine, and practise fencing. M. de Valençay,
	who was afterwards elevated to the rank of a cardinal, stood
	very high in the estimation of De Bouteville and his gang. Hardly
	a day passed but what he was engaged in some duel or other, either
	as principal or second; and he once challenged De Bouteville himself,
	his best friend, because De Bouteville had fought a duel without
	inviting him to become his second. This quarrel was only appeased
	on the promise of De Bouteville that, in his next encounter, he would
	not fail to avail himself of his services. For that purpose he went
	out the same day, and picked a quarrel with the Marquis des Portes.
	M. de Valençay, according to agreement, had the pleasure of serving
	as his second, and of running through the body M. de Cavois, the
	second of the Marquis des Portes, a man who had never done him any
	injury, and whom he afterwards acknowledged he had never seen before.</p>

	<p>Cardinal Richelieu devoted much attention to this lamentable state
	of public morals, and seems to have concurred with his great predecessor
	Sully, that nothing but the most rigorous severity could put a
	stop to the evil. The subject indeed was painfully forced upon him
	by his enemies. The Marquis de Themines, to whom Richelieu, then
	Bishop of Luçon, had given offence by some representations he had
	made to Mary of Medicis, determined, since he could not challenge an
	ecclesiastic, to challenge his brother. An opportunity was soon found.
	Themines, accosting the Marquis de Richelieu, complained, in an insulting
	tone, that the Bishop of Luçon had broken his faith. The
	Marquis resented both the manner and matter of his speech, and
	readily accepted a challenge. They met in the Rue d’Angoulême,
	and the unfortunate Richelieu was stabbed to the heart, and instantly
	expired. From that moment the bishop became the steady foe of the
	practice of duelling. Reason and the impulse of brotherly love alike
	<a class="pagenum" id="page281" title="281"></a>combined to make him detest it, and when his power in France was
	firmly established, he set vigorously about repressing it. In his <cite>Testament
	Politique</cite>, he has collected his thoughts upon the subject, in
	the chapter entitled “Des moyens d’arrêter les Duels.” In spite of
	the edicts that he published, the members of the nobility persisted in
	fighting upon the most trivial and absurd pretences. At last Richelieu
	made a terrible example. The infamous De Bouteville challenged
	and fought the Marquis de Beuvron; and although the duel itself
	was not fatal to either, its consequences were fatal to both. High as
	they were, Richelieu resolved that the law should reach them both,
	and they were both tried, found guilty, and beheaded. Thus did
	society get rid of one of the most bloodthirsty scoundrels that ever
	polluted it.</p>

	</div>

	<p>In 1632 two noblemen fought a duel in which they were both
	killed. The officers of justice had notice of the breach of the law,
	and arrived at the scene of combat before the friends of the parties
	had time to remove the bodies. In conformity with the cardinal’s
	severe code upon the subject, the
	bodies were ignominiously stripped
	and hanged upon a gallows with
	their heads downwards, for several
	hours, within sight of all the people.<a href="#fn62" id="fnm62" title="Mercure de France..." class="fnmarker">62</a>
	This severity sobered the frenzy of
	the nation for a time; but it was
	soon forgotten. Men’s minds were
	too deeply imbued with a false notion
	of honour to be brought to a right
	way of thinking: by such examples,
	however striking, Richelieu was unable
	to persuade them to walk in the
	right path, though he could punish
	them for choosing the wrong one. He
	had with all his acuteness, miscalculated the spirit of duelling. It was
	not death that a duellist feared; it was shame, and the contempt of
	his fellows. As Addison remarked more than eighty years afterwards,
	“Death was not sufficient to deter men who made it their glory to
	despise it; but if every one who fought a duel were to stand in the
	pillory, it would quickly diminish the number of those imaginary men
	of honour, and put an end to so absurd a practice.” Richelieu never
	thought of this.</p>
	
	<p>Sully says, that in his time the Germans were also much addicted
	to duelling. There were three places where it was legal to fight;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page282" title="282"></a>Witzburg in Franconia, and Uspach and Halle in Swabia. Thither
	of course, vast numbers repaired, and murdered each other under
	sanction of the law. At an earlier period in Germany, it was held
	highly disgraceful to refuse to fight. Any one who surrendered to
	his adversary for a simple wound that did not disable him, was reputed
	infamous, and could neither cut his beard, bear arms, mount
	on horseback, or hold any office in the state. He who fell in a duel
	was buried with great pomp and splendour.</p>

	<p>In the year 1652, just after Louis XIV. had attained his majority,
	a desperate duel was fought between the Dukes de Beaufort and
	De Nemours, each attended by four gentlemen. Although
	brothers-in-law, they had long been enemies, and their constant dissensions
	had introduced much disorganisation among the troops which they
	severally commanded. Each had long sought an opportunity for combat,
	which at last arose on a misunderstanding relative to the places
	they were to occupy at the council-board. They fought with pistols,
	and, at the first discharge, the Duke de Nemours was shot through
	the body, and almost instantly expired. Upon this the Marquis de
	Villars, who seconded Nemours, challenged Héricourt, the second of
	the Duke de Beaufort, a man whom he had never before seen; and
	the challenge being accepted, they fought even more desperately than
	their principals. This combat, being with swords, lasted longer than
	the first, and was more exciting to the six remaining gentlemen who
	stayed to witness it. The result was fatal to Héricourt, who fell
	pierced to the heart by the sword of De Villars. Any thing more
	savage than this can hardly be imagined. Voltaire says such duels
	were frequent, and the compiler of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire d’Anecdotes</cite> informs
	us that the number of seconds was not fixed. As many as ten,
	or twelve, or twenty, were not unfrequent, and they often fought
	together after their principals were disabled. The highest mark of
	friendship one man could manifest towards another, was to choose
	him for his second; and many gentlemen were so desirous of serving
	in this capacity, that they endeavoured to raise every slight misunderstanding
	into a quarrel, that they might have the pleasure of being
	engaged in it. The Count de Bussy-Rabutin relates an instance of
	this in his Memoirs. He says, that as he was one evening coming
	out of the theatre, a gentleman named Bruc, whom he had not before
	known, stopped him very politely, and, drawing him aside,
	asked him if it was true that the Count de Thianges had called him
	(Bruc) a drunkard? Bussy replied that he really did not know, for
	he saw the count very seldom. “Oh, he is your uncle!” replied
	Bruc; “and, as I cannot have satisfaction from him, because he
	lives so far off in the country, I apply to you.” “I see what you are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283"></a>at,” replied Bussy, “and, since you wish to put me in my uncle’s
	place, I answer, that whoever asserted that he called you a drunkard,
	told a lie!” “My brother said so,” replied Bruc, “and he is a child.”
	“Horsewhip him, then, for his falsehood,” returned De Bussy. “I
	will not have my brother called, a liar,” returned Bruc, determined
	to quarrel with him; “so draw, and defend yourself!” They both
	drew their swords in the public street, but were separated by the spectators.
	They agreed, however, to fight on a future occasion, and with
	all the regular forms of the duello. A few days afterwards, a gentleman,
	whom De Bussy had never before seen, and whom he did not
	know even by name, called upon him and asked if he might have
	the privilege of serving as his second. He added, that he neither
	knew him nor Bruc, except by reputation, but having made up his
	mind to be second of one of them, he had decided upon accompanying
	De Bussy as the braver man of the two. De Bussy thanked him
	very sincerely for his politeness, but begged to be excused, as he had
	already engaged four seconds to accompany him, and he was afraid
	that if he took any more the affair would become a battle instead of
	a duel.</p>

	<p>When such quarrels as these were looked upon as mere matters of
	course, the state of society must have been indeed awful. Louis XIV.
	very early saw the evil, and as early determined to remedy it. It was
	not, however, till the year 1679, when he instituted the “Chambre
	Ardente,” for the trial of the slow poisoners and pretenders to sorcery,
	that he published any edict against duelling. In that year his famous
	edict was promulgated, in which he reiterated and confirmed the
	severe enactments of his predecessors Henry IV. and Louis XIII., and
	expressed his determination never to pardon any offender. By this
	celebrated ordinance a supreme court of honour was established, composed
	of the marshals of France. They were bound, on taking the
	office, to give to every one who brought a well-founded complaint before
	them, such reparation as would satisfy the justice of the case.
	Should any gentleman against whom complaint was made refuse to
	obey the mandate of the court of honour, he might be punished by
	fine and imprisonment; and when that was not possible, by reason
	of his absenting himself from the kingdom, his estates might be confiscated
	till his return.</p>

	<p>Every man who sent a challenge, be the cause of offence what it
	might, was deprived of all redress from the court of
	honour—suspended three years from the exercise of any office in the state—was
	further imprisoned for two years, and sentenced to pay a fine of half
	his yearly income.</p>

	<p>He who accepted a challenge was subject to the same punishment.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284"></a>Any servant or other person, who knowingly became the bearer of a
	challenge, was, if found guilty, sentenced to stand in the pillory and
	be publicly whipped for the first offence; and for the second, sent for
	three years to the galleys.</p>

	<p>Any person who actually fought, was to be held guilty of murder,
	even though death did not ensue, and was to be punished accordingly.
	Persons in the higher ranks of life were to be beheaded, and those of
	the middle class hanged upon a gallows, and their bodies refused
	Christian burial.</p>

	<p>At the same time that Louis published this severe edict, he exacted
	a promise from his principal nobility that they would never engage
	in a duel on any pretence whatever. He never swerved from his
	resolution to pursue all duellists with the utmost rigour, and many
	were executed in various parts of the country. A slight abatement
	of the evil was the consequence, and in the course of a few years one
	duel was not fought where twelve had been fought previously. A
	medal was struck to commemorate the circumstance, by the express
	command of the king. So much had he this object at heart, that, in
	his will, he particularly recommended to his successor the care of his
	edict against duelling, and warned him against any ill-judged lenity
	to those who disobeyed it.</p>
	
	<p>A singular law formerly existed in Malta with regard to duelling.
	By this law it was permitted, but only upon condition that the parties
	should fight in one particular street. If they presumed to settle their
	quarrel elsewhere, they were held guilty of murder, and punished
	accordingly. What was also very singular, they were bound, under
	heavy penalties, to put up their swords when requested to do so by a
	priest, a knight, or a woman. It does not appear, however, that the
	ladies or the knights exercised this mild and beneficent privilege to
	any great extent; the former were too often themselves the cause of
	duels, and the latter sympathised too much in the wounded honour
	of the combatants to attempt to separate them. The priests alone
	were the great peacemakers. Brydone says, that a cross was always
	painted on the wall opposite to the spot where a knight had been
	killed, and that in the “street of duels” he counted about twenty of
	them.<a href="#fn63" id="fnm63" title="Brydone’s..." class="fnmarker">63</a></p>

	<p>In England the private duel was also practised to a scandalous
	extent, towards the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth
	centuries. The judicial combat now began to be more rare,
	but several instances of it are mentioned in history. One was instituted
	in the reign of Elizabeth, and another so late as the time of
	Charles I. Sir Henry Spelman gives an account of that which took
	<a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285"></a>place in Elizabeth’s reign, which is curious, perhaps the more so when
	we consider that it was perfectly legal, and that similar combats remained
	so till the year 1819. A proceeding having been instituted
	in the Court of Common Pleas for the recovery of certain manorial
	rights in the county of Kent, the defendant offered to prove by single
	combat his right to retain possession. The plaintiff accepted the
	challenge, and the Court having no power to stay the proceedings,
	agreed to the champions who were to fight in lieu of the principals.
	The queen commanded the parties to compromise; but it being represented
	to her majesty that they were justified by law in the course
	they were pursuing, she allowed them to proceed. On the day appointed,
	the justices of the Common Pleas, and all the counsel
	engaged in the cause, appeared as umpires of the combat, at a place
	in Tothill-fields, where the lists had been prepared. The champions
	were ready for the encounter, and the plaintiff and defendant were
	publicly called to come forward and acknowledge them. The defendant
	answered to his name, and recognised his champion with the due
	formalities, but the plaintiff did not appear. Without his presence
	and authority the combat could not take place; and his absence being
	considered an abandonment of his claim, he was declared to be non-suited,
	and barred for ever from renewing his suit before any other
	tribunal whatever.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The queen appears to have disapproved personally of this mode of
	settling a disputed claim, but her judges and legal advisers made no
	attempt to alter the barbarous law. The practice of private duelling
	excited more indignation, from its being of every-day occurrence. In
	the time of James I. the English were so infected with the French
	madness, that Bacon, when he was attorney-general, lent the aid of
	his powerful eloquence to effect a reformation of the evil. Informations
	were exhibited in the Star Chamber against two persons, named
	Priest and Wright, for being engaged, as principal and second, in a
	duel, on which occasion he delivered a charge that was so highly
	approved of by the Lords of the Council, that they ordered it to be
	printed and circulated over the country, as a thing “very meet and
	worthy to be remembered and made known unto the world.” He
	began by considering the nature and greatness of the mischief of
	duelling. “It troubleth peace—it disfurnisheth war—it bringeth
	calamity upon private men, peril upon the state, and contempt upon
	the law. Touching the cause of it,” he observed, “that the first
	motive of it, no doubt, is a false and erroneous imagination of honour
	and credit; but then, the seed of this mischief being such, it is
	nourished by vain discourses and green and unripe conceits. Hereunto
	may be added, that men have almost lost the true notion and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286"></a>understanding of fortitude and valour. For fortitude distinguisheth
	of the grounds of quarrel whether they be just; and not only so, but
	whether they be worthy, and setteth a better price upon men’s lives
	than to bestow them idly. Nay,
	it is weakness and disesteem of a
	man’s self to put a man’s life
	upon such liedger performances.
	A man’s life is not to be trifled
	with; it is to be offered up and
	sacrificed to honourable services,
	public merits, good causes, and
	noble adventures. It is in expense
	of blood as it is in expense
	of money. It is no liberality to
	make a profusion of money upon
	every vain occasion, neither is
	it fortitude to make effusion of
	blood, except the cause of it be
	worth.”<a href="#fn64" id="fnm64" title="See Life and Character of Lord Bacon..." class="fnmarker">64</a></p>

	<p>The most remarkable event connected with duelling in this reign
	was that between Lord Sanquir, a Scotch nobleman, and one Turner,
	a fencing-master. In a trial of skill between them, his lordship’s
	eye was accidentally thrust out by the point of Turner’s sword. Turner
	expressed great regret at the circumstance, and Lord Sanquir bore
	his loss with as much philosophy as he was master of, and forgave
	his antagonist. Three years afterwards, Lord Sanquir was at Paris,
	where he was a constant visitor at the court of Henry IV. One day,
	in the course of conversation, the affable monarch inquired how he
	had lost his eye. Sanquir, who prided himself on being the most
	expert swordsman of the age, blushed as he replied that it was
	inflicted by the sword of a fencing-master. Henry, forgetting his
	assumed character of an anti-duellist, carelessly, and as a mere matter
	of course, inquired whether the man lived? Nothing more was said;
	but the query sank deep into the proud heart of the Scotch baron,
	who returned shortly afterwards to England, burning for revenge.
	His first intent was to challenge the fencing-master to single combat;
	but, on further consideration, he deemed it inconsistent with his dignity
	to meet him as an equal in fair and open fight. He therefore
	hired two bravos, who set upon the fencing-master, and murdered
	him in his own house at Whitefriars. The assassins were taken and
	executed, and a reward of one thousand pounds offered for the apprehension
	of their employer. Lord Sanquir concealed himself for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287"></a>several days, and then surrendered to take his trial, in the hope (happily
	false) that Justice would belie her name, and be lenient to a murderer
	because he was a nobleman, who on a false point of honour had
	thought fit to take revenge into his own hands. The most powerful
	intercessions were employed in his favour, but James, to his credit,
	was deaf to them all. Bacon, in his character of attorney-general,
	prosecuted the prisoner to conviction; and he died the felon’s death
	on the 29th of June, 1612, on a gibbet erected in front of the gate of
	Westminster Hall.</p>

	<p>With regard to the public duel, or trial by battle, demanded under
	the sanction of the law, to terminate a quarrel which the ordinary
	course of justice could with difficulty decide, Bacon was equally opposed
	to it, and thought that in no case should it be granted. He
	suggested that there should be declared a constant and settled resolution
	in the state to abolish it altogether; that care should be taken
	that the evil be no more cockered, nor the humour of it fed, but that
	all persons found guilty should be rigorously punished by the Star
	Chamber, and those of eminent quality banished from the court.</p>

	<p>In the succeeding reign, when Donald Mackay, the first Lord
	Reay, accused David Ramsay of treason, in being concerned with the
	Marquis of Hamilton in a design upon the crown of Scotland, he was
	challenged by the latter to make good his assertion by single combat.<a href="#fn65" id="fnm65" title="See History..." class="fnmarker">65</a>
	It had been at first the intention of the government to try the case
	by the common law, but Ramsay thought he would stand a better
	chance of escape by recurring to the old and almost exploded custom,
	but which was still the right of every man in appeals of treason.
	Lord Reay readily accepted the challenge, and both were confined in
	the Tower until they found security that they would appear on a
	certain day appointed by the court to determine the question. The
	management of the affair was delegated to the Marischal Court of
	Westminster, and the Earl of Lindsay was created Lord Constable of
	England for the purpose. Shortly before the day appointed, Ramsay
	confessed in substance all that Lord Reay had laid to his charge, upon
	which Charles I. put a stop to the proceedings.</p>
	
	<p>But in England, about this period, sterner disputes arose among
	men than those mere individual matters which generate duels. The
	men of the Commonwealth encouraged no practice of the kind, and
	the subdued aristocracy carried their habits and prejudices elsewhere,
	and fought their duels at foreign courts. Cromwell’s parliament,
	however—although the evil at that time was not so crying—published
	an order in 1654 for the prevention of duels, and the punishment
	of all concerned in them. Charles II., on his restoration, also
	<a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288"></a>issued a proclamation upon the subject. In his reign an infamous
	duel was fought—infamous not only from its own circumstances, but
	from the lenity that was shewn to the principal offenders.</p>

	<p>The worthless Duke of Buckingham, having debauched the Countess
	of Shrewsbury, was challenged by her husband to mortal combat
	in January 1668. Charles II. endeavoured to prevent the duel, not
	from any regard to public morality, but from fear for the life of his
	favourite. He gave commands to the Duke of Albemarle to confine
	Buckingham to his house, or take some other measures to prevent
	him from fighting. Albemarle neglected the order, thinking that the
	king himself might prevent the combat by some surer means. The
	meeting took place at Barn Elms; the injured Shrewsbury being attended
	by Sir John Talbot, his relative, and Lord Bernard Howard,
	son of the Earl of Arundel. Buckingham was accompanied by two
	of his dependents, Captain Holmes and Sir John Jenkins. According
	to the barbarous custom of the age, not only the principals, but the
	seconds engaged each other. Jenkins was pierced to the heart, and
	left dead upon the field, and Sir John Talbot severely wounded in
	both arms. Buckingham himself escaping with slight wounds, ran
	his unfortunate antagonist through the body, and then left the field
	with the wretched woman, the cause of all the mischief, who, in the
	dress of a page, awaited the issue of the conflict in a neighbouring
	wood, holding her paramour’s horse to avoid suspicion. Great influence
	was exerted to save the guilty parties from punishment, and
	the master, as base as the favourite, made little difficulty in granting
	a free pardon to all concerned. In a royal proclamation issued shortly
	afterwards, Charles II. formally pardoned the murderers, but declared
	his intention never to extend in future any mercy to such offenders.
	It would be hard, after this, to say who was the most infamous, the
	king, the favourite, or the courtesan.</p>

	<p>In the reign of Queen Anne, repeated complaints were made of
	the prevalence of duelling. Addison, Swift, Steele, and other writers
	employed their powerful pens in reprobation of it. Steele especially,
	in the <cite>Tatler</cite> and <cite>Guardian</cite>, exposed its impiety and absurdity, and
	endeavoured both by argument and by ridicule to bring his countrymen
	to a right way of thinking.<a href="#fn66" id="fnm66" title="See Spectator..." class="fnmarker">66</a> His comedy of <cite>The Conscious
	Lovers</cite> contains an admirable exposure of the abuse of the word
	<em>honour</em>, which led men into an error so lamentable. Swift, writing
	upon the subject, remarked that he could see no harm in rogues and
	fools shooting each other. Addison and Steele took higher ground;
	and the latter, in the <cite>Guardian</cite>, summed up nearly all that could be
	<a class="pagenum" id="page289" title="289"></a>said upon the subject in the following impressive words:—“A Christian
	and a gentleman are made inconsistent appellations of the same
	person. You are not to expect eternal life if you do not forgive injuries,
	and your mortal life is rendered uncomfortable if you are not
	ready to commit a murder in resentment of an affront; for good sense,
	as well as religion, is so utterly banished the world, that men glory
	in their very passions, and pursue trifles with the utmost vengeance,
	so little do they know that to forgive is the most arduous pitch human
	nature can arrive at. A coward has often fought, a coward has often
	conquered; but a coward never forgave.” Steele also published a
	pamphlet, in which he gave a detailed account of the edict of Louis
	XIV., and the measures taken by that monarch to cure his subjects
	of their murderous folly.</p>
	
	<p>On the 8th of May, 1711, Sir Cholmely Deering, M.P. for the
	county of Kent, was slain in a duel by Mr. Richard Thornhill, also a
	member of the House of Commons. Three days afterwards, Sir Peter
	King brought the subject under the notice of the legislature; and
	after dwelling at considerable length on the alarming increase of the
	practice, obtained leave to bring in a bill for the prevention and
	punishment of duelling. It was read a first time that day, and ordered
	for a second reading in the ensuing week.</p>

	<p>About the same time, the attention of the Upper House of Parliament
	was also drawn to the subject in the most painful manner. Two
	of its most noted members would have fought had it not been that
	Queen Anne received notice of their intention, and exacted a pledge
	that they would desist; while a few months afterwards two other of
	its members lost their lives in one of the most remarkable duels upon
	record. The first affair, which happily terminated without a meeting,
	was between the Duke of Marlborough and the Earl Pawlet; the
	latter and fatal encounter was between the Duke of Hamilton and
	Lord Mohun.</p>

	<p>The first arose out of a debate in the Lords upon the conduct of
	the Duke of Ormond in refusing to hazard a general engagement with
	the enemy, in which Earl Pawlet remarked that nobody could doubt
	the courage of the Duke of Ormond. “He was not like a certain
	general, who led troops to the slaughter, to cause great numbers of
	officers to be knocked on the head in a battle, or against stone walls,
	in order to fill his pockets by disposing of their commissions.” Every
	one felt that the remark was aimed at the Duke of Marlborough, but
	he remained silent, though evidently suffering in mind. Soon after
	the House broke up, the Earl Pawlet received a visit from Lord Mohun,
	who told him that the Duke of Marlborough was anxious to
	come to an explanation with him relative to some expressions he had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290"></a>made use of in that day’s debate, and therefore prayed him to “go
	and take a little air in the country.” Earl Pawlet did not affect to
	misunderstand the hint, but asked him in plain terms whether he
	brought a challenge from the duke. Lord Mohun said his message
	needed no explanation, and that he [Lord Mohun] would accompany
	the Duke of Marlborough. He then took his leave, and Earl Pawlet
	returned home and told his lady that he was going out to fight a duel
	with the Duke of Marlborough. His lady, alarmed for her lord’s
	safety, gave notice of his intention to the Earl of Dartmouth, who
	immediately, in the queen’s name, sent to the Duke of Marlborough,
	and commanded him not to stir abroad. He also caused Earl Pawlet’s
	house to be guarded by two sentinels; and having taken these precautions,
	informed the queen of the whole affair. Her Majesty sent
	at once for the duke, expressed her abhorrence of the custom of
	duelling, and required his word of honour that he would proceed no
	further. The duke pledged his word accordingly, and the affair
	terminated.</p>

	<p>The lamentable duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord
	Mohun took place in November 1712, and sprang from the following
	circumstances. A lawsuit had been pending for eleven years between
	these two noblemen, and they looked upon each other in consequence
	with a certain degree of coldness. They met together on the 13th of
	November in the chambers of Mr. Orlebar, a master in Chancery,
	when, in the course of conversation, the Duke of Hamilton reflected
	upon the conduct of one of the witnesses in the cause, saying that he
	was a person who had neither truth nor justice in him. Lord Mohun,
	somewhat nettled at this remark applied to a witness favourable to
	his side, made answer hastily, that Mr. Whiteworth, the person alluded
	to, had quite as much truth and justice in him as the Duke of Hamilton.
	The duke made no reply, and no one present imagined that he
	took offence at what was said; and when he went out of the room
	he made a low and courteous salute to the Lord Mohun. In the
	evening, General Macartney called twice upon the duke with a challenge
	from Lord Mohun, and failing in seeing him, sought him a
	third time at a tavern, where he found him, and delivered his
	message. The duke accepted the challenge, and the day after the
	morrow, which was Sunday, the 15th of November, at seven in the
	morning, was appointed for the meeting.</p>

	<p>At that hour they assembled in Hyde Park, the duke being attended
	by his relative Colonel Hamilton, and the Lord Mohun by
	General Macartney. They jumped over a ditch into a place called
	the Nursery, and prepared for the combat. The Duke of Hamilton,
	turning to General Macartney, said, “<em>Sir, you are the cause of this,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291"></a>let the event be what it will.</em>” Lord Mohun did not wish that the
	seconds should engage, but the duke insisted that “<em>Macartney should
	have a share in the dance.</em>” All being ready, the two principals took
	up their positions, and fought with swords so desperately, that after
	a short time they both fell down mortally wounded. The Lord
	Mohun expired upon the spot, and the Duke of Hamilton in the arms
	of his servants as they were carrying him to his coach.</p>

	<p>This unhappy termination caused the greatest excitement not only
	in the metropolis, but all over the country. The Tories, grieved at
	the loss of the Duke of Hamilton, charged the fatal combat on the
	Whig party, whose leader, the Duke of Marlborough, had so recently
	set the example of political duels. They called Lord Mohun the bully
	of the Whig faction (he had already killed three men in duels, and
	been twice tried for murder), and asserted openly that the quarrel was
	concocted between him and General Macartney to rob the country of
	the services of the Duke of Hamilton by murdering him. It was also
	asserted that the wound of which the duke died was not inflicted by
	Lord Mohun, but by Macartney; and every means was used to propagate
	this belief. Colonel Hamilton, against whom and Macartney
	the coroner’s jury had returned a verdict of wilful murder, surrendered
	a few days afterwards, and was examined before a privy council sitting
	at the house of Lord Dartmouth. He then deposed, that seeing
	Lord Mohun fall, and the duke upon him, he ran to the duke’s assistance;
	and that he might with the more ease help him, he flung down
	both their swords, and as he was raising the duke up, <em>he saw Macartney
	make a push at him</em>. Upon this deposition, a royal proclamation
	was immediately issued, offering a reward of 500<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> for the apprehension
	of Macartney, to which the Duchess of Hamilton afterwards
	added a reward of 300<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr></p>

	<p>Upon the further examination of Colonel Hamilton, it was found
	that reliance could not be placed on all his statements, and that he
	contradicted himself in several important particulars. He was arraigned
	at the old Bailey for the murder of Lord Mohun, the whole
	political circles of London being in a fever of excitement for the result.
	All the Tory party prayed for his acquittal, and a Tory mob
	surrounded the doors and all the avenues leading to the court of
	justice for many hours before the trial began. The examination
	of witnesses lasted seven hours. The criminal still persisted in
	accusing General Macartney of the murder of the Duke of Hamilton,
	but in other respects, say the newspapers of the day, prevaricated
	foully. He was found guilty of manslaughter. This favourable
	verdict was received with universal applause, “not only from
	the court and all the gentlemen present, but the common people
	<a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292"></a>shewed a mighty satisfaction, which they testified by loud and repeated
	huzzas.”<a href="#fn67" id="fnm67" title="Post-Boy..." class="fnmarker">67</a></p>

	<p>As the popular delirium subsided, and men began to reason coolly
	upon the subject, they disbelieved the assertions of Colonel Hamilton
	that Macartney had stabbed the duke, although it was universally
	admitted that he had been much too busy and presuming. Hamilton
	was shunned by all his former companions, and his life rendered so
	irksome to him, that he sold out of the Guards and retired to private
	life, in which he died heart-broken four years afterwards.</p>

	<p>General Macartney surrendered about the same time, and was
	tried for murder in the Court of King’s Bench. He was, however,
	found guilty of manslaughter only.</p>

	<p>At the opening of the session of Parliament of 1713, the queen
	made pointed allusion in her speech to the frequency of duelling, and
	recommended to the legislature to devise some speedy and effectual
	remedy for it. A bill to that effect was brought forward, but thrown
	out on the second reading, to the very great regret of all the sensible
	portion of the community.</p>

	<p>A famous duel was fought in 1765 between Lord Byron and Mr.
	Chaworth. The dispute arose at a club-dinner, and was relative to
	which of the two had the largest quantity of game on his estates.
	Infuriated by wine and passion, they retired instantly into an adjoining
	room, and fought with swords across a table, by the feeble glimmer
	of a tallow candle. Mr. Chaworth, who was the more expert
	swordsman of the two, received a mortal wound, and shortly afterwards
	expired. Lord Byron was brought to trial for the murder before
	the House of Lords; and it appearing clearly that the duel was not
	premeditated, but fought at once, and in the heat of passion, he was
	found guilty of manslaughter only, and ordered to be discharged upon
	payment of his fees. This was a very bad example for the country,
	and duelling of course fell into no disrepute after such a verdict.</p>

	<p>In France more severity was exercised. In the year 1769, the
	Parliament of Grenoble took cognisance of the delinquency of the
	Sieur Duchelas, one of its members, who challenged and killed in a
	duel a captain of the Flemish legion. The servant of Duchelas officiated
	as second, and was arraigned with his master for the murder
	of the captain. They were both found guilty. Duchelas was broken
	alive on the wheel, and the servant condemned to the galleys for
	life.</p>

	<p>A barbarous and fiercely-contested duel was fought in November
	1778, between two foreign adventurers, at Bath, named Count Rice
	and the Vicomte du Barri. Some dispute arose relative to a gambling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page293" title="293"></a>transaction, in the course of which Du Barri contradicted an assertion
	of the other, by saying “That is not true!” Count Rice immediately
	asked him if he knew the very disagreeable meaning of
	the words he had employed. Du Barri said he was perfectly well
	aware of their meaning, and that Rice might interpret them just
	as he pleased. A challenge was immediately given and accepted.
	Seconds were sent for, who, arriving with but little delay, the whole
	party, though it was not long after midnight, proceeded to a place
	called Claverton Down, where they remained with a surgeon until
	daylight. They then prepared for the encounter, each being armed with
	two pistols and a sword. The ground having been marked out by the
	seconds, Du Barri fired first, and wounded his opponent in the thigh.
	Count Rice then levelled his pistol, and shot Du Barri mortally in
	the breast. So angry were the combatants, that they refused to desist;
	both stepped back a few paces, and then rushing forward, discharged
	their second pistols at each other. Neither shot took effect,
	and both throwing away their pistols, prepared to finish the sanguinary
	struggle by the sword. They took their places, and were advancing
	towards each other, when the Vicomte du Barri suddenly
	staggered, grew pale, and, falling on the ground, exclaimed, “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je
	vous demande ma vie</em>.” His opponent had but just time to answer,
	that he granted it, when the unfortunate Du Barri turned upon the
	grass, and expired with a heavy groan. The survivor of this savage
	conflict was then removed to his lodgings, where he lay for some
	weeks in a dangerous state. The coroner’s jury, in the mean while,
	sat upon the body of Du Barri, and disgraced themselves by returning
	a verdict of manslaughter only. Count Rice, upon his recovery,
	was indicted for the murder notwithstanding this verdict. On his
	trial he entered into a long defence of his conduct, pleading the
	fairness of the duel, and its unpremeditated nature; and, at the
	same time, expressing his deep regret for the unfortunate death
	of Du Barri, with whom for many years he had been bound in ties
	of the strictest friendship. These considerations appear to have
	weighed with the jury, and this fierce duellist was again found
	guilty of manslaughter only, and escaped with a merely nominal
	punishment.</p>

	<p>A duel, less remarkable from its circumstances, but more so from
	the rank of the parties, took place in 1789. The combatants on this
	occasion were the Duke of York and Colonel Lenox, the nephew and
	heir of the Duke of Richmond. The cause of offence was given by the
	Duke of York, who had said in presence of several officers of the Guards,
	that words had been used to Colonel Lenox at Daubigny’s to which
	no gentleman ought to have submitted. Colonel Lenox went up
	<a class="pagenum" id="page294" title="294"></a>to the duke on parade, and asked him publicly whether he had
	made such an assertion. The Duke of York, without answering his
	question, coldly ordered him to his post. When parade was over, he
	took an opportunity of saying publicly in the orderly-room before
	Colonel Lenox, that he desired no protection from his rank as a
	prince and his station as commanding officer; adding that, when he
	was off duty he wore a plain brown coat like a private gentleman,
	and was ready as such to give satisfaction. Colonel Lenox desired
	nothing better than satisfaction; that is to say, to run the chance
	of shooting the duke through the body, or being himself shot. He accordingly
	challenged his Royal Highness, and they met on Wimbledon
	Common. Colonel Lenox fired first, and the ball whizzed past the
	head of his opponent, so near to it as to graze his projecting curl.
	The duke refused to return the fire, and the seconds interfering, the
	affair terminated.</p>

	<p>Colonel Lenox was very shortly afterwards engaged in another
	duel arising out of this. A Mr. Swift wrote a pamphlet in reference
	to the dispute between him and the Duke of York, at some expressions
	in which he took so much offence, as to imagine that nothing
	but a shot at the writer could atone for them. They met on the
	Uxbridge Road, but no damage was done to either party.</p>

	<p>The Irish were for a long time renowned for their love of duelling.
	The slightest offence which it is possible to imagine that one
	man could offer to another was sufficient to provoke a challenge.
	Sir Jonah Barrington relates, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, that, previous to the
	Union, during the time of a disputed election in Dublin, it was no
	unusual thing for three-and-twenty duels to be fought in a day.
	Even in times of less excitement, they were so common as to be
	deemed unworthy of note by the regular chroniclers of events, except
	in cases where one or both of the combatants were killed.</p>

	<p>In those days, in Ireland, it was not only the man of the military,
	but of every profession, who had to work his way to eminence
	with the sword or the pistol. Each political party had its regular
	corps of bullies, or fire-eaters, as they were called, who qualified
	themselves for being the pests of society by spending all their spare
	time in firing at targets. They boasted that they could hit an opponent
	in any part of his body they pleased, and made up their minds
	before the encounter began whether they should kill him, disable,
	or disfigure him for life—lay him on a bed of suffering for a twelvemonth,
	or merely graze a limb.</p>

	<p>The evil had reached an alarming height, when, in the year
	1808, an opportunity was offered to King George III. of shewing
	in a striking manner his detestation of the practice, and of setting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page295" title="295"></a>an example to the Irish that such murders were not to be committed
	with impunity. A dispute arose, in the month of June 1807, between
	Major Campbell and Captain Boyd, officers of the 21st regiment,
	stationed in Ireland, about the proper manner of giving the
	word of command on parade. Hot words ensued on this slight occasion,
	and the result was a challenge from Campbell to Boyd. They
	retired into the mess-room shortly afterwards, and each stationed himself
	at a corner, the distance obliquely being but seven paces. Here,
	without friends or seconds being present, they fired at each other,
	and Captain Boyd fell mortally wounded between the fourth and fifth
	ribs. A surgeon, who came in shortly, found him sitting in a chair,
	vomiting and suffering great agony. He was led into another room,
	Major Campbell following, in great distress and perturbation of mind.
	Boyd survived but eighteen hours, and just before his death, said, in
	reply to a question from his opponent, that the duel was not fair,
	and added, “You hurried me, Campbell—you’re a bad man.”—“Good
	God!” replied Campbell, “will you mention before these
	gentlemen, was not every thing fair? Did you not say that you
	were ready?” Boyd answered faintly, “Oh, no! you know I wanted
	you to wait and have friends.” On being again asked whether all
	was fair, the dying man faintly murmured, “Yes:” but in a minute
	after, he said, “You’re a bad man!” Campbell was now in great
	agitation, and ringing his hands convulsively, he exclaimed, “Oh,
	Boyd! you are the happiest man of the two! Do you forgive me?”
	Boyd replied, “I forgive you—I feel for you, as I know you do for
	me.” He shortly afterwards expired, and Major Campbell made
	his escape from Ireland, and lived for some months with his family
	under an assumed name, in the neighbourhood of Chelsea. He was,
	however, apprehended, and brought to trial at Armagh, in August
	1808. He said while in prison, that, if found guilty of murder, he
	should suffer as an example to duellists in Ireland; but he endeavoured
	to buoy himself up with the hope that the jury would only convict
	him of manslaughter. It was proved in evidence upon the trial,
	that the duel was not fought immediately after the offence was given,
	but that Major Campbell went home and drank tea with his family
	before he sought Boyd for the fatal encounter. The jury returned a
	verdict of wilful murder against him, but recommended him to mercy
	on the ground that the duel had been a fair one. He was condemned
	to die on the Monday following, but was afterwards respited for a few
	days longer. In the mean time the greatest exertions were made in
	his behalf. His unfortunate wife went upon her knees before the
	Prince of Wales, to move him to use his influence with the king
	in favour of her unhappy husband. Every thing a fond wife and a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page296" title="296"></a>courageous woman could do she tried, to gain the royal clemency;
	but George III. was inflexible, in consequence of the representations
	of the Irish viceroy that an example was necessary. The law was
	therefore allowed to take its course, and the victim of a false spirit
	of honour died the death of a felon.</p>

	<p>The most inveterate duellists of the present day are the students
	in the Universities of Germany. They fight on the most frivolous
	pretences, and settle with swords and pistols the schoolboy disputes
	which in other countries are arranged by the more harmless medium
	of the fisticuffs. It was at one time the custom among these savage
	youths to prefer the sword-combat, for the facility it gave them of
	cutting off the noses of their opponents. To disfigure them in this
	manner was an object of ambition, and the German duellists reckoned
	the number of these disgusting trophies which they had borne away,
	with as much satisfaction as a successful general the provinces he
	had reduced or the cities he had taken.</p>

	<p>But it would be wearisome to enter into the minute detail of all
	the duels of modern times. If an examination were made into the
	general causes which produced them, it would be found that in every
	case they had been either of the most trivial or the most unworthy
	nature. Parliamentary duels were at one time very common, and
	amongst the names of those who have soiled a great reputation by conforming
	to the practice, may be mentioned those of Warren Hastings,
	Sir Philip Francis, Wilkes, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, Curran, Tierney, and
	Canning. So difficult is it even for the superior mind to free itself
	from the trammels with which foolish opinion has enswathed it—not
	one of these celebrated persons who did not in his secret soul
	condemn the folly to which he lent himself. The bonds of reason,
	though iron-strong, are easily burst through; but those of folly,
	though lithe and frail as the rushes by a stream, defy the stoutest
	heart to snap them asunder. Colonel Thomas, an officer in the
	Guards, who was killed in a duel, added the following clause to his
	will the night before he died:—“In the first place, I commit my soul
	to Almighty God, in hope of his mercy and pardon for the irreligious
	step I now (in compliance with the unwarrantable customs of this
	wicked world) put myself under the necessity of taking.” How many
	have been in the same state of mind as this wise, foolish man! He
	knew his error, and abhorred it, but could not resist it for fear of
	the opinion of the prejudiced and unthinking. No other could have
	blamed him for refusing to fight a duel.</p>

	<p>The list of duels that have sprung from the most degrading causes
	might be stretched out to an almost indefinite extent. Sterne’s father
	fought a duel about a goose; and the great Raleigh about a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297"></a>tavern-bill.<a href="#fn68" id="fnm68" title="Raleigh at one period of his life..." class="fnmarker">68</a> Scores of duels (many of them fatal) have been fought from
	disputes at cards, or a place at a theatre; while hundreds of challenges,
	given and accepted over-night, in a fit of drunkenness, have
	been fought out the next morning to the death of one or both of the
	antagonists.</p>
	
	<p>Two of the most notorious duels of modern times had their origin
	in causes no more worthy than the quarrel of a dog and the favour of
	a prostitute: that between Macnamara and Montgomery arising from
	the former; and that between Best and Lord Camelford from the
	latter. The dog of Montgomery attacked a dog belonging to Macnamara,
	and each master interfering in behalf of his own animal, high
	words ensued. The result was the giving and accepting a challenge
	to mortal combat. The parties met on the following day, when
	Montgomery was shot dead, and his antagonist severely wounded.
	The affair created a great sensation at the time, and Heaviside, the
	surgeon who attended at the fatal field to render his assistance if
	necessary, was arrested as an accessory to the murder, and committed
	to Newgate.</p>

	<p>In the duel between Best and Lord Camelford, two pistols were
	used which were considered to be the best in England. One of them
	was thought slightly superior to the other, and it was agreed that
	the belligerents should toss up a piece of money to decide the choice
	of weapons. Best gained it, and at the first discharge, Lord Camelford
	fell mortally wounded. But little sympathy was expressed for
	his fate; he was a confirmed duellist, had been engaged in many
	meetings of the kind, and the blood of more than one fellow-creature
	lay at his door. As he had sowed, so did he reap; and the violent
	man met an appropriate death.</p>

	<p>It now only remains to notice the means that have been taken to
	stay the prevalence of this madness of false honour in the various
	countries of the civilised world. The efforts of the governments of
	France and England have already been mentioned, and their want of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298"></a>success is but too well known. The same efforts have been attended
	with the same results elsewhere. In despotic countries, where the
	will of the monarch has been strongly expressed and vigorously supported,
	a diminution of the evil has for a time resulted, but only to
	be increased again, when death relaxed the iron grasp, and a successor
	appeared of less decided opinions on the subject. This was
	the case in Prussia, under the great Frederick, of whose aversion to
	duelling a popular anecdote is recorded. It is stated of him that he
	permitted duelling in his army, but only upon the condition that the
	combatants should fight in presence of a whole battalion of infantry,
	drawn up on purpose to see fair play. The latter received strict
	orders, when one of the belligerents fell, to shoot the other immediately.
	It is added, that the known determination of the king
	effectually put a stop to the practice.</p>

	<p>The Emperor Joseph II. of Austria was as firm as Frederick,
	although the measures he adopted were not so singular. The following
	letter explains his views on the subject:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“<span class="special_name">To General</span> <span class="omitted"> * * * * *</span></p>

		<p>“<span class="special_name">My General</span>,</p>
		
		<p>“You will immediately arrest the Count of K. and Captain W.
		The count is young, passionate, and influenced by wrong notions of
		birth and a false spirit of honour. Captain W. is an old soldier, who
		will adjust every dispute with the sword and pistol, and who has received
		the challenge of the young count with unbecoming warmth.</p>

		<p>“I will suffer no duelling in my army. I despise the principles
		of those who attempt to justify the practice, and who would run each
		other through the body in cold blood.</p>

		<p>“When I have officers who bravely expose themselves to every
		danger in facing the enemy—who at all times exhibit courage,
		valour, and resolution in attack and defence, I esteem them highly.
		The coolness with which they meet death on such occasions is serviceable
		to their country, and at the same time redounds to their
		own honour; but should there be men amongst them who are ready
		to sacrifice every thing to their vengeance and hatred, I despise them.
		I consider such a man as no better than a Roman gladiator.</p>

		<p>“Order a court-martial to try the two officers. Investigate the
		subject of their dispute with that impartiality which I demand from
		every judge; and he that is guilty, let him be a sacrifice to his fate
		and the laws.</p>

		<p>“Such a barbarous custom, which suits the age of the Tamerlanes
		and Bajazets, and which has often had such melancholy effects on
		single families, I will have suppressed and punished, even if it should
		<a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299"></a>deprive me of one half of my officers. There are still men who know
		how to unite the character of a hero with that of a good subject; and
		he only can be so who respects the laws.</p>
		
		<p>“<em>August, 1771.</em> <span class="special_name" style="float:right;margin-right:1em;">Joseph</span>.”<a href="#fn69" id="fnm69" title="Vide the Letters of Joseph II..." class="fnmarker">69</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>In the United States of America the code varies considerably. In
	one or two of the still wild and simple states of the far West, where
	no duel has yet been fought, there is no specific law upon the subject
	beyond that in the Decalogue, which says, “Thou shalt do no murder;”
	but duelling every where follows the steps of modern civilisation;
	and by the time the backwoodsman is transformed into the
	citizen, he has imbibed the false notions of honour which are prevalent
	in Europe and around him, and is ready, like his progenitors, to
	settle his differences with the pistol. In the majority of the States
	the punishment for challenging, fighting, or acting as second, is solitary
	imprisonment and hard labour for any period less than a year,
	and disqualification for serving any public office for twenty years.
	In Vermont the punishment is total disqualification for office, deprivation
	of the rights of citizenship, and a fine; in fatal cases, the same
	punishment as that of murderers. In Rhode Island, the combatant,
	though death does not ensue, is liable to be carted to the gallows,
	with a rope about his neck, and to sit in this trim for an hour exposed
	to the peltings of the mob. He may be further imprisoned for a year,
	at the option of the magistrate. In Connecticut the punishment is
	total disqualification for office or employ, and a fine varying from one
	hundred to a thousand dollars. The laws of Illinois require certain
	officers of the state to make oath, previous to their instalment, that
	they have never been, nor ever will be, concerned in a duel.<a href="#fn70" id="fnm70" title="Encyclopedia Americana..." class="fnmarker">70</a></p>
	
	<p>Amongst the edicts against duelling, promulgated at various times
	in Europe, may be mentioned that of Augustus King of Poland, in
	1712, which decreed the punishment of death against principals and
	seconds, and minor punishments against the bearers of a challenge.
	An edict was also published at Munich, in 1773, according to which
	both principals and seconds, even in duels where no one was either
	killed or wounded, should be hanged, and their bodies buried at the
	foot of the gallows.</p>

	<p>The king of Naples issued an ordinance against duelling in 1838,
	in which the punishment of death is decreed against all concerned in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300"></a>a fatal duel. The bodies of those killed, and of those who may be
	executed in consequence, are to be buried in unconsecrated ground,
	and without any religious ceremony; nor is any monument to be
	erected on the spot. The punishment for duels in which either, or
	both, are wounded, and for those in which no damage whatever is
	done, varies according to the case, and consists of fine, imprisonment,
	loss of rank and honours, and incapacity for filling any public situation.
	Bearers of challenges may also be punished with fine and imprisonment.</p>

	<p>It might be imagined that enactments so severe all over the civilised
	world would finally eradicate a custom, the prevalence of which
	every wise and good man must deplore. But the frowns of the law
	never yet have taught, and never will teach, men to desist from this
	practice, as long as it is felt that the lawgiver sympathises with it in
	his heart. The stern judge upon the bench may say to the unfortunate
	wight who has been called a liar by some unmannerly opponent,
	“If you challenge him, you meditate murder, and are guilty of murder!”
	but the same judge, divested of his robes of state, and mixing
	in the world with other men, would say, “If you do not challenge
	him, if you do not run the risk of making yourself a murderer, you
	will be looked upon as a mean-spirited wretch, unfit to associate with
	your fellows, and deserving nothing but their scorn and their contempt!”
	It is society, and not the duellist, who is to blame. Female
	influence too, which is so powerful in leading men either to good or
	to evil, takes in this case the evil part. Mere animal bravery has,
	unfortunately, such charms in the female eye, that a successful duellist
	is but too often regarded as a sort of hero; and the man who refuses
	to fight, though of truer courage, is thought a poltroon, who may be
	trampled on. Mr. Graves, a member of the American legislature, who,
	early in 1838, killed a Mr. Cilley in a duel, truly and eloquently said,
	on the floor of the House of Representatives, when lamenting the
	unfortunate issue of that encounter, that society was more to blame
	than he was. “Public opinion,” said the repentant orator, “is practically
	the paramount law of the land. Every other law, both human
	and divine, ceases to be observed; yea, withers and perishes in contact
	with it. It was this paramount law of this nation and of this
	House that forced me, under the penalty of dishonour, to subject
	myself to the code, which impelled me unwillingly into this tragical
	affair. Upon the heads of this nation, and at the doors of this House,
	rests the blood with which my unfortunate hands have been stained!”</p>

	<p>As long as society is in this mood; as long as it thinks that the
	man who refuses to resent an insult, deserved that insult, and should
	be scouted accordingly; so long, it is to be feared, will duelling exist,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page301" title="301"></a>however severe the laws may be. Men must have redress for injuries
	inflicted; and when those injuries are of such a nature that no tribunal
	will take cognisance of them, the injured will take the law into
	their own hands, and right themselves in the opinion of their fellows,
	at the hazard of their lives. Much as the sage may affect to despise
	the opinion of the world, there are few who would not rather expose
	their lives a hundred times than be condemned to live on, in society,
	but not of it—a by-word of reproach to all who know their history,
	and a mark for scorn to point his finger at.</p>

	<p>The only practicable means for diminishing the force of a custom
	which is the disgrace of civilisation, seems to be the establishment of
	a court of honour, which should take cognisance of all those delicate
	and almost intangible offences which yet wound so deeply. The court
	established by Louis XIV. might be taken as a model. No man now
	fights a duel when a fit apology has been offered; and it should be the
	duty of this court to weigh dispassionately the complaint of every
	man injured in his honour, either by word or deed, and to force the
	offender to make a public apology. If he refused the apology, he
	would be the breaker of a second law; an offender against a high
	court, as well as against the man he had injured, and might be
	punished with fine and imprisonment, the latter to last until he saw
	the error of his conduct, and made the concession which the court
	demanded.</p>

	<p>If, after the establishment of this tribunal, men should be found
	of a nature so bloodthirsty as not to be satisfied with its peaceful
	decisions, and should resort to the old and barbarous mode of an
	appeal to the pistol, some means might be found of dealing with
	them. To hang them as murderers would be of no avail; for to such
	men death would have few terrors. Shame alone would bring them
	to reason. Transportation, the tread-wheel, or a public whipping,
	would perhaps be sufficient.</p>

	be eradicated as long as feeling and
	affection are denizens of the heart.
	It is a love which is most easily excited
	in the best and kindliest natures,
	and which few are callous enough to
	scoff at. Who would not treasure
	the lock of hair that once adorned
	the brow of the faithful wife now
	cold in death, or that hung down the
	neck of a beloved infant now sleeping
	under the sward? Not one!
	They are home-relics, whose sacred
	worth is intelligible to all: spoils
	rescued from the devouring grave,
	which to the affectionate are beyond
	all price. How dear to a forlorn survivor
	the book over whose pages he has pored with one departed!
	How much greater its value, if that hand, now cold, had written a
	thought, an opinion, or a name, upon the leaf! Besides these sweet
	domestic relics, there are others which no one can condemn: relics
	sanctified by that admiration of greatness and goodness which is
	akin to love; such as the copy of Montaigne’s <cite>Florio</cite>, with the name
	of Shakspeare upon the leaf, written by the poet of all time himself;
	the chair preserved at Antwerp, in which Rubens sat when he painted
	the immortal Descent from the Cross; or the telescope, preserved in
	the Museum of Florence, which aided Galileo in his sublime discoveries.
	Who would not look with veneration upon the undoubted
	<a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303"></a>arrow of William Tell—the swords of Wallace or of Hampden—or
	the Bible whose leaves were turned by some stern old father of the
	faith?</p>
	
	<p>Thus the principle of reliquism is hallowed and enshrined by love.
	But from this germ of purity how numerous the progeny of errors and
	superstitions! Men, in their admiration of the great, and of all that
	appertained to them, have forgotten that goodness is a component
	part of true greatness, and have made fools of themselves for the jawbone
	of a saint, the toe-nail of an apostle, the handkerchief a king
	blew his nose in, or the rope that hanged a criminal. Desiring to
	rescue some slight token from the graves of their predecessors, they
	have confounded the famous and the infamous, the renowned and the
	notorious. Great saints, great sinners; great philosophers, great
	quacks; great conquerors, great murderers; great ministers, great
	thieves; each and all have had their admirers, ready to ransack earth,
	from the equator to either pole, to find a relic of them.</p>

	<p>The reliquism of modern times dates its origin from the centuries
	immediately preceding the Crusades. The first pilgrims to the Holy
	Land brought back to Europe thousands of apocryphal relics, in the
	purchase of which they had expended all their store. The greatest
	favourite was the wood of the true cross, which, like the oil of the
	widow, never diminished. It is generally asserted, in the traditions
	of the Romish Church, that the Empress Helen, the mother of Constantine
	the Great, first discovered the veritable “<i>true cross</i>” in her
	pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The Emperor Theodosius made a present
	of the greater part of it to St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, by whom
	it was studded with precious stones, and deposited in the principal
	church of that city. It was carried away by the Huns, by whom it
	was burnt, after they had extracted the valuable jewels it contained.
	Fragments, purporting to have been cut from it, were, in the eleventh
	and twelfth centuries, to be found in almost every church in Europe,
	and would, if collected together in one place, have been almost sufficient
	to have built a cathedral. Happy was the sinner who could
	get a sight of one of them; happier he who possessed one! To obtain
	them the greatest dangers were cheerfully braved. They were
	thought to preserve from all evils, and to cure the most inveterate
	diseases. Annual pilgrimages were made to the shrines that contained
	them, and considerable revenues collected from the devotees.</p>

	<p>Next in renown were those precious relics, the tears of the Saviour.
	By whom and in what manner they were preserved, the pilgrims did
	not inquire. Their genuineness was vouched by the Christians of the
	Holy Land, and that was sufficient. Tears of the Virgin Mary, and
	tears of St. Peter, were also to be had, carefully enclosed in little
	<a class="pagenum" id="page304" title="304"></a>caskets, which the pious might wear in their bosoms. After the tears
	the next most precious relics were drops of the blood of Jesus and
	the martyrs, and the milk of the Virgin Mary. Hair and toe-nails
	were also in great repute, and were sold at extravagant prices. Thousands
	of pilgrims annually visited Palestine in the eleventh and twelfth
	centuries, to purchase pretended relics for the home market. The
	majority of them had no other means of subsistence than the profits
	thus obtained. Many a nail, cut from the filthy foot of some unscrupulous
	ecclesiastic, was sold at a diamond’s price, within six months
	after its severance from its parent toe, upon the supposition that it
	had once belonged to a saint or an apostle. Peter’s toes were uncommonly
	prolific, for there were nails enough in Europe, at the time of
	the Council of Clermont, to have filled a sack, all of which were devoutly
	believed to have grown on the sacred feet of that great apostle.
	Some of them are still shewn in the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle.
	The pious come from a distance of a hundred German miles to feast
	their eyes upon them.</p>

	<p>At Port Royal, in Paris, is kept with great care a thorn, which
	the priests of that seminary assert to be one of the identical thorns
	that bound the holy head of the Son of God. How it came there,
	and by whom it was preserved, has never been explained. This is
	the famous thorn, celebrated in the long dissensions of the Jansenists
	and the Molenists, and which worked the miraculous cure upon
	Mademoiselle Perrier: by merely kissing it she was cured of a disease
	of the eyes of long standing.<a href="#fn71" id="fnm71" title="Voltaire..." class="fnmarker">71</a></p>
	
	<p>What traveller is unacquainted with the Santa Scala, or Holy
	Stairs, at Rome? They were brought from Jerusalem along with the
	true cross, by the Empress Helen, and were taken from the house
	which, according to popular tradition, was inhabited by Pontius
	Pilate. They are said to be the steps which Jesus ascended and
	descended when brought into the presence of the Roman governor.
	They are held in the greatest veneration at Rome: it is sacrilegious
	to walk upon them. The knees of the faithful must alone touch
	them in ascending or descending, and that only after the pilgrims
	have reverentially kissed them.</p>

	<p>Europe still swarms with these religious relics. There is hardly
	a Roman Catholic church in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, or Belgium,
	without one or more of them. Even the poorly endowed
	churches of the villages boast the possession of miraculous thigh-bones
	of the innumerable saints of the Romish calendar. Aix-la-Chapelle
	is proud of the veritable <i>châsse</i>, or thigh-bone of Charlemagne,
	which cures lameness. Halle has a thigh-bone of the Virgin
	<a class="pagenum" id="page305" title="305"></a>Mary; Spain has seven or eight, all said to be undoubted relics.
	Brussels at one time preserved, and perhaps does now, the teeth of
	St. Gudule. The faithful, who suffered from the toothache, had
	only to pray, look at them, and be cured. Some of these holy bones
	have been buried in different parts of the Continent. After a certain
	lapse of time, water is said to ooze from them, which soon forms a
	spring, and cures all the diseases of the faithful.</p>

	<p>It is curious to remark the avidity manifested in all ages, and in
	all countries, to obtain possession of some relic of any persons who
	have been much spoken of, even for their crimes. When William
	Longbeard, leader of the populace of London in the reign of Richard I.,
	was hanged at Smithfield, the utmost eagerness was shewn to obtain
	a hair from his head, or a shred from his garments. Women came
	from Essex, Kent, Suffolk, Sussex, and all the surrounding counties,
	to collect the mould at the foot of his gallows. A hair of his beard
	was believed to preserve from evil spirits, and a piece of his clothes
	from aches and pains.</p>

	<p>In more modern days, a similar avidity was shewn to obtain a
	relic of the luckless Masaniello, the fisherman of Naples. After he
	had been raised by mob favour to a height of power more despotic
	than monarch ever wielded, he was shot by the same populace in the
	streets, as if he had been a mad dog. His headless trunk was dragged
	through the mire for several hours, and cast at night-fall into the
	city ditch. On the morrow the tide of popular feeling turned once
	more in his favour. His corpse was sought, arrayed in royal robes,
	and buried magnificently by torch-light in the cathedral, ten thousand
	armed men, and as many mourners, attending at the ceremony. The
	fisherman’s dress which he had worn was rent into shreds by the
	crowd, to be preserved as relics; the door of his hut was pulled off
	its hinges by a mob of women, and eagerly cut up into small pieces,
	to be made into images, caskets, and other mementos. The scanty
	furniture of his poor abode became of more value than the adornments
	of a palace; the ground he had walked upon was considered
	sacred, and, being collected in small phials, was sold at its weight in
	gold, and worn in the bosom as an amulet.</p>

	<p>Almost as extraordinary was the frenzy manifested by the populace
	of Paris on the execution of the atrocious Marchioness de Brinvilliers.
	There were grounds for the popular wonder in the case of
	Masaniello, who was unstained with personal crimes. But the career
	of Madame de Brinvilliers was of a nature to excite no other feelings
	than disgust and abhorrence. She was convicted of poisoning several
	persons, and sentenced to be burned in the Place de Grève, and to
	have her ashes scattered to the winds. On the day of her execution,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page306" title="306"></a>the populace, struck by her gracefulness and beauty, inveighed against
	the severity of her sentence. Their pity soon increased to admiration,
	and, ere evening, she was considered a saint. Her ashes were
	industriously collected; even the charred wood, which had aided to
	consume her, was eagerly purchased by the populace. Her ashes
	were thought to preserve from witchcraft.</p>

	<p>In England many persons have a singular love for the relics of
	thieves and murderers, or other great criminals. The ropes with
	which they have been hanged are very often bought by collectors at
	a guinea per foot. Great sums were paid for the rope which hanged
	Dr. Dodd, and for those more recently which did justice upon Mr.
	Fauntleroy for forgery, and on Thurtell for the murder of Mr. Weare.
	The murder of Maria Marten, by Corder, in the year 1828, excited
	the greatest interest all over the country. People came from Wales
	and Scotland, and even from Ireland, to visit the barn where the
	body of the murdered woman was buried. Every one of them was
	anxious to carry away some memorial of his visit. Pieces of the barn-door,
	tiles from the roof, and, above all, the clothes of the poor victim,
	were eagerly sought after. A lock of her hair was sold for two
	guineas, and the purchaser thought himself fortunate in getting it so
	cheaply.</p>

	<p>So great was the concourse of people to visit the house in Camberwell
	Lane, where Greenacre murdered Hannah Brown, in 1837,
	that it was found necessary to station a strong detachment of police
	on the spot. The crowd was so eager to obtain a relic of the house
	of this atrocious criminal, that the police were obliged to employ
	force to prevent the tables and chairs, and even the doors, from being
	carried away.</p>

	<p>In earlier times, a singular superstition was attached to the hand
	of a criminal who had suffered execution. It was thought that by
	merely rubbing the dead hand on the body, the patient afflicted
	with the king’s evil would be instantly cured. The executioner
	at Newgate formerly derived no inconsiderable revenue from this
	foolish practice. The possession of the hand was thought to be of
	still greater efficacy in the cure of diseases and the prevention of
	misfortunes. In the time of Charles II., as much as ten guineas was
	thought a small price for one of these disgusting relics.</p>

	<p>When the maniac, Thom, or Courtenay, was shot, in the spring of
	1838, the relic-hunters were immediately in motion to obtain a memento
	of so extraordinary an individual. His long black beard and
	hair, which were cut off by the surgeons, fell into the hands of his
	disciples, by whom they were treasured with the utmost reverence. A
	lock of his hair commanded a great price, not only amongst his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page307" title="307"></a>followers, but among the more wealthy inhabitants of Canterbury and
	its neighbourhood. The tree against which he fell when he was shot,
	was stripped of all its bark by the curious; while a letter, with his
	signature to it, was paid for in gold coins; and his favourite horse
	became as celebrated as its master. Parties of ladies and gentlemen
	went to Boughton from a distance of a hundred and fifty miles, to
	visit the scene of that fatal affray, and stroke on the back the horse
	of the “mad knight of Malta.” If a strict watch had not been kept
	over his grave for months, the body would have been disinterred, and
	the bones carried away as memorials.</p>

	<p>Among the Chinese no relics are more valued than the <i>boots</i> which
	have been worn by an upright magistrate. In Davis’s interesting
	description of the empire of China, we are informed, that whenever
	a judge of unusual integrity resigns his situation, the people all congregate
	to do him honour. If he leaves the city where he has presided,
	the crowd accompany him from his residence to the gates,
	where his boots are drawn off with great ceremony, to be preserved
	in the hall of justice. Their place is immediately supplied by a
	new pair, which, in their turn, are drawn off to make room for
	others before he has worn them five minutes, it being considered
	sufficient to consecrate them that he should have merely drawn them
	on.</p>

	<p>Among the most favourite relics of modern times, in Europe, are
	Shakspeare’s mulberry-tree, Napoleon’s willow, and the table at Waterloo
	on which the emperor wrote his despatches. Snuff-boxes of
	Shakspeare’s mulberry-tree are comparatively rare, though there are
	doubtless more of them in the market than were ever made of the
	wood planted by the great bard. Many a piece of alien wood passes
	under this name. The same may be said of Napoleon’s table at Waterloo.
	The original has long since been destroyed, and a round
	dozen of counterfeits along with it. Many preserve the simple stick
	of wood; others have them cut into brooches and every variety of
	ornament; but by far the greater number prefer them as snuff-boxes.
	In France they are made into <i>bonbonnières</i>, and are much esteemed
	by the many thousands whose cheeks still glow and whose eyes still
	sparkle at the name of Napoleon.</p>

	<p>Bullets from the field of Waterloo, and buttons from the coats of
	the soldiers who fell in the fight, are still favourite relics in Europe.
	But the same ingenuity which found new tables after the old one was
	destroyed, has cast new bullets for the curious. Many a one who
	thinks himself the possessor of a bullet which aided in giving peace
	to the world on that memorable day, is the owner of a dump, first
	extracted from the ore a dozen years afterwards. Let all lovers of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page308" title="308"></a>genuine relics look well to their money before they part with it to
	the ciceroni that swarm in the village of Waterloo!</p>

	<p>Few travellers stopped at the lonely isle of St. Helena without cutting
	a twig from the willow that drooped over the grave of Napoleon,
	prior to the removal of the body by the government of Louis Philippe.
	Many of them have since been planted in different parts of Europe,
	and have grown into trees as large as their parent. Relic-hunters,
	who are unable to procure a twig of the original, are content with
	one from these. Several of them are growing in the neighbourhood
	of London.</p>

	<p>But in relics, as in every thing else, there is the use and the
	abuse. The undoubted relics of great men, or great events, will
	always possess attractions for the thinking and refined. There
	are few who would not join with Cowley in the extravagant wish
	introduced in his lines “written while sitting in a chair made of
	the remains of the ship in which Sir Francis Drake sailed round the
	world:”</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>And I myself, who now love quiet too,</p>
		<p>Almost as much, as any chair can do,</p>
		<p>Would yet a journey take</p>
		<p class="i6">An old wheel of that chariot to see,</p>
		<p>Which Phaeton so rashly brake.</p>

			swords, and stones instead of arrows, they ranged themselves in battle order, and, shouting

			<p>The sacking of Vitry reflects indelible disgrace upon Louis VII. His predecessors
			had been long engaged in resistance to the outrageous powers assumed by the Popes,
			and Louis continued the same policy. The ecclesiastical chapter of Bourges, having
			elected an archbishop without his consent, he proclaimed the election to be invalid, and
			took severe and prompt measures against the refractory clergy. Thibault count de
			Champagne took up arms in defence of the Papal authority, and entrenched himself
			in the town of Vitry. Louis immediately took the field to chastise the rebel, and he
			besieged the town with so much vigour that the count was forced to surrender. Upwards
			of thirteen hundred of the inhabitants, fully one half of whom were women and

			<p>Slow poisoning is a crime which has unhappily been revived in England within the

			<p>The woman whose ghost was said to manifest itself in Cock Lane was buried in
			the crypt or cloister of St. John, Clerkenwell. The vault is composed of two aisles,
			that on the south being much narrower than the other,—it was here she was deposited.</p>

			<p>About seven years since, I was sketching a picturesque trefoil-headed door leading
			into this part of the vault; and the place being at that time in great confusion with coffins,
			remains of bodies, some of which were dried like mummies, &amp;c., I could find no better
			seat than one of the coffins. The sexton’s boy, who held my light, informed me this
			was the coffin of <em>Scratching Fanny</em>, which recalled the Cock Lane story to my mind.
			I got off the lid of the coffin, and saw the face of a handsome woman, with an aquiline
			nose; this feature remaining perfect, an uncommon case, for the cartilage mostly gives
			way. The remains had become adipocere, and were perfectly preserved. She was said
			to have been poisoned by deleterious punch, but this was legally disproved; and, if I
			remember rightly, she was otherwise declared to have died of small-pox; of this disease
			there was not the least sign; but as some mineral poisons tend to render bodies adipocere,
			here was some evidence in support of the former allegation. I made particular inquiries
			at the time of Mr. Bird, churchwarden, a respectable and judicious man; and he
			gave me good assurance that this coffin had always been looked upon as the one containing
			the Cock Lane woman. Since that time the vault has been set in order, and the
			above-mentioned coffin, with others, put away.</p>

			<p>The niche near the window in the drawing of the Ghost Room is the place where

			<p>Since the publication of the first edition of this volume, Jack Sheppard’s adventures
			have been revived. A novel upon the real or fabulous history of the burglar has afforded,
			by its extraordinary popularity, a further exemplification of the allegations in the text.
			The <cite>Sixth Report of the Inspector of Prisons for the Northern Districts of England</cite> contains
			a mass of information upon the pernicious effect of such romances, and of the dramas
			founded upon them. The Inspector examined several boys attending the prison school
			in the New Bailey at Manchester, from whose evidence the following passages bearing
			upon the subject are extracted:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>“J. L. (aged 14). The first time I was ever at the theatre was to see <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite>.
				There were two or three boys near to the house who were going, and they asked me.
				I took sixpence from the money I used to lay up weekly for clothes. The next time I
				went, which was the week after, I borrowed the money from a boy; I returned it to him
				the Saturday after. I then went many times. I took the money from my mother out of
				her pocket as she was sitting down, and I beside her. There was more than sixpence in
				her pocket. I got a great love for the theatre, and stole from people often to get there. <em>I
				thought this Jack Sheppard was a clever fellow</em> for making his escape and robbing his master.
				<em>If I could get out of gaol, I think I should be as clever as him</em>: but, after all his exploits, he
				got done at last. I have had the book out of a library at Dole Field. I had paid two-pence
				a book for three volumes. I also got <cite>Richard Turpin</cite>, in two volumes, and paid the
				same. I have seen <cite>Oliver Twist</cite>, and think the Artful Dodger is very like some of the
				boys here. I am here for picking a pocket of 25<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr></p>

				<p>“H. C. (aged 15). When we came to Manchester, I went to the play, and saw <cite>Jack
				Sheppard</cite> the first night it came out. There were pictures of him about the streets on
				boards and on the walls; one of them was his picking a pocket in the church. I liked
				<cite>Jack Sheppard</cite> much. I had not been in prison there. I was employed in a warehouse
				at 6<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr class="foreign" title="pence">d.</abbr> a-week, and was allowed 6<abbr class="foreign" title="pence">d.</abbr> out of it for myself, and with that I went regularly
				to the play. I saw <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite> afterwards four times in one week. I got the money
				out of my money-bag by stealth, and without my master’s knowledge. I once borrowed
				10<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> in my mother’s name from Mrs. ——, a shopkeeper, with whom she used to deal;
				I went to the play with it.</p>

				<p>“J. M’D. (aged 15). I have heard of <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite>: a lad whom I know told me of it,
				who had seen it, and said it was <em>rare fun</em> to see him break out of prison.</p>

				<p>“J. L. (aged 11). Has been to the play twice, and seen <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite>. Went with his
				brother the first time, and by himself the second. I took the money to go a second time
				out of mother’s house, off the chimney-piece, where she had left a sixpence. It was the
				first night <cite>Jack Sheppard</cite> was played. There was great talk about it, and there were nice
				pictures about it all over the walls. I thought him a very clever fellow; but Blueskin
				made the most fun. I first went to the markets, and begun by stealing apples. I also
				knew a lad, ——, who has been transported, and went with him two or three times.
				The most I ever got was 10<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> out of a till.”</p>

			<p>Very similar to this is the fire-ordeal of the modern Hindoos, which is thus
			described in Forbes’s <cite>Oriental Memoirs</cite>, <abbr title="volume one chapter 11">vol. i. c. xi.</abbr>:—“When a man, accused of a
			capital crime, chooses to undergo the ordeal trial, he is closely confined for several days;
			his right hand and arm are covered with thick wax-cloth, tied up and sealed, in the
			presence of proper officers, to prevent deceit. In the English districts the covering was
			always sealed with the Company’s arms, and the prisoner placed under an European
			guard. At the time fixed for the ordeal, a caldron of oil is placed over a fire; when it
			boils, a piece of money is dropped into the vessel; the prisoner’s arm is unsealed and
			washed in the presence of his judges and accusers. During this part of the ceremony
			the attendant Brahmins supplicate the Deity. On receiving their benediction, the
			accused plunges his hand into the boiling fluid, and takes out the coin. The arm is
			afterwards again sealed up until the time appointed for a re-examination. The seal is
			then broken; if no blemish appears, the prisoner is declared innocent; if the contrary,
			he suffers the punishment due to his crime.”… On this trial the accused thus
			addresses the element before plunging his hand into the boiling oil:—“Thou, O fire! pervadest
			all things. O cause of purity! who givest evidence of virtue and of sin, declare
			the truth in this my hand!” If no juggling were practised, the decisions by this ordeal
			would be all the same way; but as some are by this means declared guilty, and others
			innocent, it is clear that the Brahmins, like the Christian priests of the middle ages,
			practise some deception in saving those whom they wish to be thought guiltless.</p>

			<p>An ordeal very like this is still practised in India. Consecrated rice is the article
			chosen, instead of bread and cheese. Instances are not rare in which, through the force
			of imagination, guilty persons are not able to swallow a single grain. Conscious of
			their crime, and fearful of the punishment of Heaven, they feel a suffocating sensation
			in their throat when they attempt it, and they fall on their knees, and confess all that is
			laid to their charge. The same thing, no doubt, would have happened with the bread
			and cheese of the Roman Church, if it had been applied to any others but ecclesiastics.
			The latter had too much wisdom to be caught in a trap of their own setting.</p>

			<p>Raleigh at one period of his life appeared to be an inveterate duellist, and it was
			said of him that he had been engaged in more encounters of the kind than any man of
			note among his contemporaries. More than one fellow-creature he had deprived of life;
			but he lived long enough to be convinced of the sinfulness of his conduct, and made a
			solemn vow never to fight another duel. The following anecdote of his forbearance is
			well known, but it will bear repetition:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>A dispute arose in a coffee-house between him and a young man on some trivial point,
				and the latter, losing his temper, impertinently spat in the face of the veteran. Sir
				Walter, instead of running him through the body, as many would have done, or challenging
				him to mortal combat, coolly took out his handkerchief, wiped his face, and said,
				“Young man, if I could as easily wipe from my conscience the stain of killing you, as I
				can this spittle from my face, you should not live another minute.” The young man
				immediately begged his pardon.</p>
