	<h2 class="fancy">Preface.</h2>
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals,
	they have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of
	excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do. We find
	that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and
	go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously
	impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is
	caught by some new folly more captivating than the first. We see one
	nation suddenly seized, from its highest to its lowest members, with a
	fierce desire of military glory; another as suddenly becoming crazed
	upon a religious scruple; and neither of them recovering its senses
	until it has shed rivers of blood and sowed a harvest of groans and
	tears, to be reaped by its posterity. At an early age in the annals of
	Europe its population lost their wits about the sepulchre of Jesus,
	and crowded in frenzied multitudes to the Holy Land; another age went
	mad for fear of the devil, and offered up hundreds of thousands of
	victims to the delusion of witchcraft. At another time, the many
	became crazed on the subject of the philosopher’s stone, and committed
	follies till then unheard of in the pursuit. It was once thought a
	venial offence, in very many countries of Europe, to destroy an enemy
	by slow poison. Persons who would have revolted at the idea of
	stabbing a man to the heart, drugged his pottage without scruple.
	Ladies of gentle birth and manners caught the contagion of murder,
	until poisoning, under their auspices, became quite fashionable. Some
	delusions, though notorious to all the world, have subsisted for ages,
	flourishing as widely among civilised and polished nations as among
	the early barbarians with whom they originated,—that of duelling, for
	instance, and the belief in omens and divination of the future, which
	seem to defy the progress of knowledge to eradicate them entirely from
	the popular mind. <a class="pagenum" id="pageviii" title="viii"></a>Money, again, has often been a cause of the delusion
	of multitudes. Sober nations have all at once become desperate
	gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece
	of paper. To trace the history of the most prominent of these
	delusions is the object of the present pages. Men, it has been well
	said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while
	they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.</p>

	<p>Some of the subjects introduced may be familiar to the reader; but the
	Author hopes that sufficient novelty of detail will be found even in
	these, to render them acceptable, while they could not be wholly
	omitted in justice to the subject of which it was proposed to treat.
	The memoirs of the South-Sea madness and the Mississippi delusion are
	more complete and copious than are to be found elsewhere; and the same
	may be said of the history of the Witch Mania, which contains an
	account of its terrific progress in Germany, a part of the subject
	which has been left comparatively untouched by Sir Walter Scott in his
	<cite>Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft</cite>, the most important that
	have yet appeared on this fearful but most interesting subject.</p>

	<p>Popular delusions began so early, spread so widely, and have lasted so
	long, that instead of two or three volumes, fifty would scarcely
	suffice to detail their history. The present may be considered more of
	a miscellany of delusions than a history—a chapter only in the great
	and awful book of human folly which yet remains to be written, and
	which Porson once jestingly said he would write in five hundred
	volumes! Interspersed are sketches of some lighter matters,—amusing
	instances of the imitativeness and wrongheadedness of the people,
	rather than examples of folly and delusion.</p>

	<p>Religious matters have been purposely excluded as incompatible with
	the limits prescribed to the present work; a mere list of them would
	alone be sufficient to occupy a volume.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> personal character and career of one man are so intimately connected

	Mississippi madness can have no fitter introduction than a sketch of the
	life of its great author John Law. Historians are divided in opinion as to
	whether they should designate him a knave <a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"></a>or a madman. Both epithets were
	unsparingly applied to him in his lifetime, and while the unhappy
	consequences of his projects were still deeply felt. Posterity, however,
	has found reason to doubt the justice of the accusation, and to confess
	that John Law was neither knave nor madman, but one more deceived than
	deceiving, more sinned against than sinning. He was thoroughly acquainted
	with the philosophy and true principles of credit. He understood the
	monetary question better than any man of his day; and if his system fell
	with a crash so tremendous, it was not so much his fault as that of the
	people amongst whom he had erected it. He did not calculate upon the
	avaricious frenzy of a whole nation; he did not see that confidence, like
	mistrust, could be increased almost <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</em>, and that hope was as
	extravagant as fear. How was he to foretell that the French people, like
	the man in the fable, would kill, in their frantic eagerness, the fine
	goose he had brought to lay them so many golden eggs? His fate was like
	that which may be supposed to have overtaken the first adventurous boatman
	who rowed from Erie to Ontario. Broad and smooth was the river on which he
	embarked; rapid and pleasant was his progress; and who was to stay him in
	his career? Alas for him! the cataract was nigh. He saw, when it was too
	late, that the tide which wafted him so joyously along was a tide of
	destruction; and when he endeavoured to retrace his way, he found that the
	current was too strong for his weak efforts to stem, and that he drew
	nearer every instant to the tremendous falls. Down he went over the sharp
	rocks, and the waters with him. <em>He</em> was dashed to pieces with his bark,
	but the waters, maddened and turned to foam by the rough descent, only
	boiled and bubbled for a time, and then flowed on again as smoothly as
	ever. Just so it was with Law and the French people. He was the boatman,
	and they were the waters.</p>

	<p>John Law was born at Edinburgh in the year 1671. His father was the
	younger son of an ancient family in Fife, and carried on the business of a
	goldsmith and banker. He amassed considerable wealth in his trade,
	sufficient to enable him to gratify the wish, so common among his
	countrymen, of adding a territorial designation to his name. He purchased
	with this view the estates of Lauriston and Randleston, on the Frith of
	Forth, on the borders of West and Mid Lothian, and was thenceforth known
	as Law of Lauriston. The subject of our memoir, being the eldest son, was
	received into his father’s counting-house at the age of fourteen, and for
	three years laboured hard to acquire an insight into the principles of
	banking as then carried on in Scotland. He had always manifested great
	love for the study of numbers, and his proficiency in the mathematics was
	considered <a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"></a>extraordinary in one of his tender years. At the age of
	seventeen he was tall, strong, and well made; and his face, although
	deeply scarred with the small-pox, was agreeable in its expression, and
	full of intelligence. At this time he began to neglect his business, and
	becoming vain of his person, indulged in considerable extravagance of
	attire. He was a great favourite with the ladies, by whom he was called
	Beau Law; while the other sex, despising his foppery, nicknamed him
	Jessamy John. At the death of his father, which happened in 1688, he
	withdrew entirely from the desk, which had become so irksome, and being
	possessed of the revenues of the paternal estate of Lauriston, he
	proceeded to London, to see the world.</p>

	<p>He was now very young, very vain, good-looking, tolerably rich, and quite
	uncontrolled. It is no wonder that, on his arrival in the capital, he
	should launch out into extravagance. He soon became a regular frequenter
	of the gaming-houses, and by pursuing a certain plan, based upon some
	abstruse calculation of chances, he contrived to gain considerable sums.
	All the gamblers envied him his luck, and many made it a point to watch
	his play, and stake their money on the same chances. In affairs of
	gallantry he was equally fortunate; ladies of the first rank smiled
	graciously upon the handsome Scotchman—the young, the rich, the witty,
	and the obliging. But all these successes only paved the way for reverses.
	After he had been for nine years exposed to the dangerous attractions of
	the gay life he was leading, he became an irrecoverable gambler. As his
	love of play increased in violence, it diminished in prudence. Great
	losses were only to be repaired by still greater ventures, and one unhappy
	day he lost more than he could repay without mortgaging his family estate.
	To that step he was driven at last. At the same time his gallantry brought
	him into trouble. A love affair, or slight flirtation, with a lady of the
	name of Villiers,<a href="#fn1" id="fnm1" title="Miss Elizabeth Villiers..." class="fnmarker">1</a> exposed him to the resentment of a Mr. Wilson, by
	whom he was challenged to fight a duel. Law accepted, and had the ill
	fortune to shoot his antagonist dead upon the spot. He was arrested the
	same day, and brought to trial for murder by the relatives of Mr. Wilson.
	He was afterwards found guilty, and sentenced to death. The sentence was
	commuted to a fine, upon the ground that the offence only amounted to
	manslaughter. An appeal being lodged by a brother of the deceased, Law was
	detained in the King’s Bench, whence, by some means or other, which he
	never explained, he contrived to escape; and an action being instituted
	against the sheriffs, he was advertised in the Gazette, and a reward
	offered for his apprehension. He was described as <a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>“Captain John Law, a
	Scotchman, aged twenty-six; a very tall, black, lean man; well shaped,
	above six feet high, with large pock-holes in his face; big nosed, and
	speaking broad and loud.” As this was rather a caricature than a
	description of him, it has been supposed that it was drawn up with a view
	to favour his escape. He succeeded in reaching the Continent, where he
	travelled for three years, and devoted much of his attention to the
	monetary and banking affairs of the countries through which he passed. He
	stayed a few months in Amsterdam, and speculated to some extent in the
	funds. His mornings were devoted to the study of finance and the
	principles of trade, and his evenings to the gaming-house. It is generally
	believed that he returned to Edinburgh in the year 1700. It is certain
	that he published in that city his <cite>Proposals and Reasons for constituting
	a Council of Trade</cite>. This pamphlet did not excite much attention.</p>

	<p>In a short time afterwards he published a project for establishing what he
	called a Land-bank,<a href="#fn2" id="fnm2" title="The wits of the day..." class="fnmarker">2</a> the notes issued by which were never to exceed
	the value of the entire lands of the state, upon ordinary interest, or
	were to be equal in value to the land, with the right to enter into
	possession at a certain time. The project excited a good deal of
	discussion in the Scottish Parliament, and a motion for the establishment
	of such a bank was brought forward by a neutral party, called the
	Squadrone, whom Law had interested in his favour. The Parliament
	ultimately passed a resolution to the effect, that, to establish any kind
	of paper credit, so as to force it to pass, was an improper expedient for
	the nation.</p>

	<p>Upon the failure of this project, and of his efforts to procure a pardon
	for the murder of Mr. Wilson, Law withdrew to the Continent, and resumed
	his old habits of gaming. For fourteen years he continued to roam about,
	in Flanders, Holland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and France. He soon became
	intimately acquainted with the extent of the trade and resources of each,
	and daily more confirmed in his opinion that no country could prosper
	without a paper currency. During the whole of this time he appears to have
	chiefly supported himself by successful play. At every gambling-house of
	note in the capitals of Europe he was known and appreciated as one better
	skilled in the intricacies of chance than any other man of the day. It is
	stated in the <cite>Biographie Universelle</cite> that he was expelled, first from
	Venice, and afterwards from Genoa, by the magistrates, who thought him a
	visitor too dangerous for the youth of those cities. During his residence
	in Paris he rendered himself obnoxious to D’Argenson, the
	lieutenant-general of the police, by whom he was ordered <a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>to quit the
	capital. This did not take place, however, before he had made the
	acquaintance, in the saloons, of the Duke de Vendôme, the Prince de Conti,
	and of the gay Duke of Orleans, the latter of whom was destined afterwards
	to exercise so much influence over his fate. The Duke of Orleans was
	pleased with the vivacity and good sense of the Scottish adventurer, while
	the latter was no less pleased with the wit and amiability of a prince who
	promised to become his patron. They were often thrown into each other’s
	society, and Law seized every opportunity to instil his financial
	doctrines into the mind of one whose proximity to the throne pointed him
	out as destined, at no very distant date, to play an important part in the
	government.</p>

		<p class="caption">THE REGENT OF FRANCE.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Shortly before the death of Louis XIV., or, as some say, in 1708, Law
	proposed a scheme of finance to Desmarets, the comptroller. Louis is
	reported to have inquired whether the projector were a Catholic, and on
	being answered in the negative, to have declined having any thing to do
	with him.<a href="#fn3" id="fnm3" title="This anecdote..." class="fnmarker">3</a></p>

	<p>It was after this repulse that he visited Italy. His mind being still
	occupied with schemes of finance, he proposed to Victor Amadeus, duke of
	Savoy, to establish his land-bank in that country. The duke replied that
	his dominions were too circumscribed for the execution of so great a
	project, and that he was by far too poor a potentate to be ruined. He
	advised him, however, to try the king of France once more; for he was
	sure, if he knew any thing of the French character, that the people would
	be delighted with a plan, not only so new, but so plausible.</p>

	<p>Louis XIV. died in 1715, and the heir to the throne being an infant only
	seven years of age, the Duke of Orleans assumed the reins of government,
	as regent, during his minority. Law now found himself in a more favourable
	position. The tide in his affairs had come, which, taken at the flood, was
	to waft him on to fortune. <a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>The regent was his friend, already acquainted
	with his theory and pretensions, and inclined, moreover, to aid him in any
	efforts to restore the wounded credit of France, bowed down to the earth
	by the extravagance of the long reign of Louis XIV.</p>

	<p>Hardly was that monarch laid in his grave ere the popular hatred,
	suppressed so long, burst forth against his memory. He who, during his
	life, had been flattered with an excess of adulation, to which history
	scarcely offers a parallel, was now cursed as a tyrant, a bigot, and a
	plunderer. His statues were pelted and disfigured; his effigies torn down,
	amid the execrations of the populace, and his name rendered synonymous
	with selfishness and oppression. The glory of his arms was forgotten, and
	nothing was remembered but his reverses, his extravagance, and his
	cruelty.</p>

	<p>The finances of the country were in a state of the utmost disorder. A
	profuse and corrupt monarch, whose profuseness and corruption were
	imitated by almost every functionary, from the highest to the lowest
	grade, had brought France to the verge of ruin. The national debt amounted
	to 3000 millions of livres, the revenue to 145 millions, and the expenses
	of government to 142 millions per annum; leaving only three millions to
	pay the interest upon 3000 millions. The first care of the regent was to
	discover a remedy for an evil of such magnitude, and a council was early
	summoned to take the matter into consideration. The Duke de St. Simon was
	of opinion that nothing could save the country from revolution but a
	remedy at once bold and dangerous. He advised the regent to convoke the
	states-general, and declare a national bankruptcy. The Duke de Noailles, a
	man of accommodating principles, an accomplished courtier, and totally
	averse from giving himself any trouble or annoyance that ingenuity could
	escape from, opposed the project of St. Simon with all his influence. He
	represented the expedient as alike dishonest and ruinous. The regent was
	of the same opinion, and this desperate remedy fell to the ground.</p>

	<p>The measures ultimately adopted, though they promised fair, only
	aggravated the evil. The first, and most dishonest measure was of no
	advantage to the state. A recoinage was ordered, by which the currency was
	depreciated one-fifth; those who took a thousand pieces of gold or silver
	to the mint received back an amount of coin of the same nominal value, but
	only four-fifths of the weight of metal. By this contrivance the treasury
	gained seventy-two millions of livres, and all the commercial operations
	of the country were disordered. A trifling diminution of the taxes
	silenced the clamours of the people, and for the slight present advantage
	the great prospective evil was forgotten.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>A Chamber of Justice was next instituted to inquire into the malversations
	of the loan-contractors and the farmers of the revenues. Tax-collectors
	are never very popular in any country, but those of France at this period
	deserved all the odium with which they were loaded. As soon as these
	farmers-general, with all their hosts of subordinate agents, called
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maltôtiers</em>,<a href="#fn4" id="fnm4" title="From maltôte..." class="fnmarker">4</a> were called to account for their misdeeds, the most
	extravagant joy took possession of the nation. The Chamber of Justice,
	instituted chiefly for this purpose, was endowed with very extensive
	powers. It was composed of the presidents and councils of the parliament,
	the judges of the Courts of Aid and of Requests, and the officers of the
	Chamber of Account, under the general presidence of the minister of
	finance. Informers were encouraged to give evidence against the offenders
	by the promise of one-fifth part of the fines and confiscations. A tenth
	of all concealed effects belonging to the guilty was promised to such as
	should furnish the means of discovering them.</p>

	<p>The promulgation of the edict constituting this court caused a degree of
	consternation among those principally concerned, which can only be
	accounted for on the supposition that their peculation had been enormous.
	But they met with no sympathy. The proceedings against them justified
	their terror. The Bastille was soon unable to contain the prisoners that
	were sent to it, and the gaols all over the country teemed with guilty or
	suspected persons. An order was issued to all innkeepers and postmasters
	to refuse horses to such as endeavoured to seek safety in flight; and all
	persons were forbidden, under heavy fines, to harbour them or favour their
	evasion. Some were condemned to the pillory, others to the galleys, and
	the least guilty to fine and imprisonment. One only, Samuel Bernard, a
	rich banker and farmer-general of a province remote from the capital, was
	sentenced to death. So great had been the illegal profits of this
	man,—looked upon as the tyrant and oppressor of his district,—that he
	offered six millions of livres, or 250,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling, to be allowed to
	escape.</p>

	<p>His bribe was refused, and he suffered the penalty of death. Others,
	perhaps more guilty, were more fortunate. Confiscation, owing to the
	concealment of their treasures by the delinquents, often produced less
	money than a fine. The severity of the government relaxed, and fines,
	under the denomination of taxes, were indiscriminately levied upon all
	offenders; but so corrupt was every department of the administration, that
	the country benefited but little by the sums which thus flowed into the
	treasury. Courtiers and courtiers’ wives and mistresses came in for the
	chief share of the spoils. One <a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>contractor had been taxed, in proportion to
	his wealth and guilt, at the sum of twelve millions of livres. The <span class="keep_together">Count <abbr title="unnamed">* * *</abbr>,</span>
	a man of some weight in the government, called upon him, and offered
	to procure a remission of the fine if he would give him a hundred thousand
	crowns. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous êtes trop tard, mon ami</span>,” replied the financier; “I have
	already made a bargain with your wife for fifty thousand.”<a href="#fn5" id="fnm5" title="This anecdote is related..." class="fnmarker">5</a></p>

	<p>About a hundred and eighty millions of livres were levied in this manner,
	of which eighty were applied in payment of the debts contracted by the
	government. The remainder found its way into the pockets of the courtiers.
	Madame de Maintenon, writing on this subject, says,—“We hear every day of
	some new grant of the regent. The people murmur very much at this mode of
	employing the money taken from the peculators.” The people, who, after the
	first burst of their resentment is over, generally express a sympathy for
	the weak, were indignant that so much severity should be used to so little
	purpose. They did not see the justice of robbing one set of rogues to
	fatten another. In a few months all the more guilty had been brought to
	punishment, and the Chamber of Justice looked for victims in humbler walks
	of life. Charges of fraud and extortion were brought against tradesmen of
	good character in consequence of the great inducements held out to common
	informers. They were compelled to lay open their affairs before this
	tribunal in order to establish their innocence. The voice of complaint
	resounded from every side; and at the expiration of a year the government
	found it advisable to discontinue further proceedings. The Chamber of
	Justice was suppressed, and a general amnesty granted to all against whom
	no charges had yet been preferred.</p>

	<p>In the midst of this financial confusion Law appeared upon the scene. No
	man felt more deeply than the regent the deplorable state of the country,
	but no man could be more averse from putting his shoulders manfully to the
	wheel. He disliked business; he signed official documents without proper
	examination, and trusted to others what he should have undertaken himself.
	The cares inseparable from his high office were burdensome to him. He saw
	that something was necessary to be done; but he lacked the energy to do
	it, and had not virtue enough to sacrifice his ease and his pleasures in
	the attempt. No wonder that, with this character, he listened favourably
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>to the mighty projects, so easy of execution, of the clever adventurer
	whom he had formerly known, and whose talents he appreciated.</p>

	<p>When Law presented himself at court he was most cordially received. He
	offered two memorials to the regent, in which he set forth the evils that
	had befallen France, owing to an insufficient currency, at different times
	depreciated. He asserted that a metallic currency, unaided by a paper
	money, was wholly inadequate to the wants of a commercial country, and
	particularly cited the examples of Great Britain and Holland to shew the
	advantages of paper. He used many sound arguments on the subject of
	credit, and proposed as a means of restoring that of Prance, then at so
	low an ebb among the nations, that he should be allowed to set up a bank,
	which should have the management of the royal revenues, and issue notes
	both on that and on landed security. He further proposed that this bank
	should be administered in the king’s name, but subject to the control of
	commissioners to be named by the States-General.</p>

	<p>While these memorials were under consideration, Law translated into French
	his essay on money and trade, and used every means to extend through the
	nation his renown as a financier. He soon became talked of. The confidants
	of the regent spread abroad his praise, and every one expected great
	things of Monsieur Lass.<a href="#fn6" id="fnm6" title="The French pronounced..." class="fnmarker">6</a></p>

	<p>On the 5th of May, 1716, a royal edict was published, by which Law was
	authorised, in conjunction with his brother, to establish a bank under the
	name of Law and Company, the notes of which should be received in payment
	of the taxes. The capital was fixed at six millions of livres, in twelve
	thousand shares of five hundred livres each, purchasable one fourth in
	specie, and the remainder in <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets d’état</em>. It was not thought
	expedient to grant him the whole of the privileges prayed for in his
	memorials until experience should have shewn their safety and advantage.</p>

	<p>Law was now on the high road to fortune. The study of thirty years was
	brought to guide him in the management of his bank. He made all his notes
	payable at sight, and in the coin current at the time they were issued.
	This last was a master-stroke of policy, and immediately rendered his
	notes more valuable than the precious metals. The latter were constantly
	liable to depreciation by the unwise tampering of the government. A
	thousand livres of silver might be worth their nominal value one day, and
	be reduced one-sixth the next, but a note of Law’s bank retained its
	original value. He publicly declared at the same time, that a banker
	deserved death if he <a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>made issues without having sufficient security to
	answer all demands. The consequence was, that his notes advanced rapidly
	in public estimation, and were received at one per cent more than specie.
	It was not long before the trade of the country felt the benefit.
	Languishing commerce began to lift up her head; the taxes were paid with
	greater regularity and less murmuring; and a degree of confidence was
	established that could not fail, if it continued, to become still more
	advantageous. In the course of a year, Law’s notes rose to fifteen per
	cent premium, while the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets d’état</em>, or notes issued by the
	government as security for the debts contracted by the extravagant Louis
	XIV., were at a discount of no less than seventy-eight and a half per
	cent. The comparison was too great in favour of Law not to attract the
	attention of the whole kingdom, and his credit extended itself day by day.
	Branches of his bank were almost simultaneously established at Lyons,
	Rochelle, Tours, Amiens, and Orleans.</p>

	<p>The regent appears to have been utterly astonished at his success, and
	gradually to have conceived the idea that paper, which could so aid a
	metallic currency, could entirely supersede it. Upon this fundamental
	error he afterwards acted. In the mean time, Law commenced the famous
	project which has handed his name down to posterity. He proposed to the
	regent (who could refuse him nothing) to establish a company that should
	have the exclusive privilege of trading to the great river Mississippi and
	the province of Louisiana, on its western bank. The country was supposed
	to abound in the precious metals; and the company, supported by the
	profits of their exclusive commerce, were to be the sole farmers of the
	taxes and sole coiners of money. Letters patent were issued, incorporating
	the company, in August 1717. The capital was divided into two hundred
	thousand shares of five hundred livres each, the whole of which might be
	paid in <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets d’état</em>, at their nominal value, although worth no more
	than a hundred and sixty livres in the market.</p>

	<p>It was now that the frenzy of speculating began to seize upon the nation.
	Law’s bank had effected so much good, that any promises for the future
	which he thought proper to make were readily believed. The regent every
	day conferred new privileges upon the fortunate projector. The bank
	obtained the monopoly of the sale of tobacco, the sole right of refinage
	of gold and silver, and was finally erected into the Royal Bank of France.
	Amid the intoxication of success, both Law and the regent forgot the maxim
	so loudly proclaimed by the former, that a banker deserved death who made
	issues of paper without the necessary funds to provide for them. As soon
	as the bank, from a private, became a public institution, the regent
	caused a fabrication of notes to the amount of one thousand millions of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>livres. This was the first departure from sound principles, and one for
	which Law is not justly blameable. While the affairs of the bank were
	under his control, the issues had never exceeded sixty millions. Whether
	Law opposed the inordinate increase is not known; but as it took place as
	soon as the bank was made a royal establishment, it is but fair to lay the
	blame of the change of system upon the regent.</p>

	<p>Law found that he lived under a despotic government; but he was not yet
	aware of the pernicious influence which such a government could exercise
	upon so delicate a framework as that of credit. He discovered it
	afterwards to his cost, but in the meantime suffered himself to be
	impelled by the regent into courses which his own reason must have
	disapproved. With a weakness most culpable, he lent his aid in inundating
	the country with paper money, which, based upon no solid foundation, was
	sure to fall, sooner or later. The extraordinary present fortune dazzled
	his eyes, and prevented him from seeing the evil day that would burst over
	his head, when once, from any cause or other, the alarm was sounded. The
	parliament were from the first jealous of his influence as a foreigner,
	and had, besides, their misgivings as to the safety of his projects. As
	his influence extended, their animosity increased. D’Aguesseau, the
	chancellor, was unceremoniously dismissed by the regent for his opposition
	to the vast increase of paper money, and the constant depreciation of the
	gold and silver coin of the realm. This only served to augment the enmity
	of the parliament, and when D’Argenson, a man devoted to the interests of
	the regent, was appointed to the vacant chancellorship, and made at the
	same time minister of finance, they became more violent than ever. The
	first measure of the new minister caused a further depreciation of the
	coin. In order to extinguish the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets d’état</em>, it was ordered that
	persons bringing to the mint four thousand livres in specie and one
	thousand livres in <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets d’état</em>, should receive back coin to the
	amount of five thousand livres. D’Argenson plumed himself mightily upon
	thus creating five thousand new and smaller livres out of the four
	thousand old and larger ones, being too ignorant of the true principles of
	trade and credit to be aware of the immense injury he was inflicting upon
	both.</p>

	<p>The parliament saw at once the impolicy and danger of such a system, and
	made repeated remonstrances to the regent. The latter refused to entertain
	their petitions, when the parliament, by a bold and very unusual stretch
	of authority, commanded that no money should be received in payment but
	that of the old standard. The regent summoned a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lit de justice</em>, and
	annulled the decree. The parliament resisted, and issued another. Again
	the regent exercised his privilege, and annulled it, till the parliament,
	stung to fiercer opposition, <a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>passed another decree, dated August 12th,
	1718, by which they forbade the bank of Law to have any concern, either
	direct or indirect, in the administration of the revenue; and prohibited
	all foreigners, under heavy penalties, from interfering, either in their
	own names, or in that of others, in the management of the finances of the
	state. The parliament considered Law to be the author of all the evil, and
	some of the councillors, in the virulence of their enmity, proposed that
	he should be brought to trial, and, if found guilty, be hung at the gates
	of the Palais de Justice.</p>

		<p class="caption">PALAIS ROYAL FROM THE GARDEN.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Law, in great alarm, fled to the Palais Royal, and threw himself on the
	protection of the regent, praying that measures might be taken to reduce
	the parliament to obedience. The regent had nothing so much at heart, both
	on that account and because of the disputes that had arisen relative to
	the legitimation of the Duke of Maine and the Count of Thoulouse, the sons
	of the late king. The parliament was ultimately overawed by the arrest of
	their president and two of the councillors, who were sent to distant
	prisons.</p>

	<p>Thus the first cloud upon Law’s prospects blew over: freed from
	apprehension of personal danger, he devoted his attention to his famous
	Mississippi project, the shares of which were rapidly rising, in spite of
	the parliament. At the commencement of the year 1719, <a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>an edict was
	published, granting to the Mississippi Company the exclusive privilege of
	trading to the East Indies, China, and the South Seas, and to all the
	possessions of the French East India Company, established by Colbert. The
	Company, in consequence of this great increase of their business, assumed,
	as more appropriate, the title of Company of the Indies, and created fifty
	thousand new shares. The prospects now held out by Law were most
	magnificent. He promised a yearly dividend of two hundred livres upon each
	share of five hundred, which, as the shares were paid for in <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets
	d’état</em> at their nominal value, but worth only 100 livres, was at the rate
	of about 120 per cent profit.</p>

		<p class="caption">LAW’S HOUSE; RUE DE QUINCAMPOIX.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The public enthusiasm, which had been so long rising, could not resist a
	vision so splendid. At least three hundred thousand applications were made
	for the fifty thousand new shares, and Law’s house <a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>in the Rue de
	Quincampoix was beset from morning to night by the eager applicants. As it
	was impossible to satisfy them all, it was several weeks before a list of
	the fortunate new stockholders could be made out, during which time the
	public impatience rose to a pitch of frenzy. Dukes, marquises, counts,
	with their duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses, waited in the streets
	for hours every day before Mr. Law’s door to know the result. At last, to
	avoid the jostling of the plebeian crowd, which, to the number of
	thousands, filled the whole thoroughfare, they took apartments in the
	adjoining houses, that they might be continually near the temple whence
	the new Plutus was diffusing wealth. Every day the value of the old shares
	increased, and the fresh applications, induced by the golden dreams of the
	whole nation, became so numerous that it was deemed advisable to create no
	less than three hundred thousand new shares, at five thousand livres each,
	in order that the regent might take advantage of the popular enthusiasm to
	pay off the national debt. For this purpose, the sum of fifteen hundred
	millions of livres was necessary. Such was the eagerness of the nation,
	that thrice the sum would have been subscribed if the government had
	authorised it.</p>

	<p>Law was now at the zenith of his prosperity, and the people were rapidly
	approaching the zenith of their infatuation. The highest and the lowest
	classes were alike filled with a vision of boundless wealth. There was not
	a person of note among the aristocracy, with the exception of the Duke of
	St. Simon and Marshal Villars, who was not engaged in buying or selling
	stock. People of every age and sex and condition in life speculated in the
	rise and fall of the Mississippi bonds. The Rue de Quincampoix was the
	grand resort of the jobbers, and it being a narrow, inconvenient street,
	accidents continually occurred in it, from the tremendous pressure of the
	crowd. Houses in it, worth, in ordinary times, a thousand livres of yearly
	rent, yielded as much as twelve or sixteen thousand. A cobbler, who had a
	stall in it, gained about two hundred livres a day by letting it out, and
	furnishing writing materials to brokers and their clients. The story goes,
	that a hunchbacked man who stood in the street gained considerable sums by
	lending his hump as a writing-desk to the eager speculators! The great
	concourse of persons who assembled to do business brought a still greater
	concourse of spectators. These again drew all the thieves and immoral
	characters of Paris to the spot, and constant riots and disturbances took
	place. At nightfall, it was often found necessary to send a troop of
	soldiers to clear the street.</p>

		<p class="caption">THE HUNCHBACK.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Law, finding the inconvenience of his residence, removed to the Place
	Vendôme, whither the crowd of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agioteurs</em> followed him. That spacious
	square soon became as thronged as the Rue de Quincampoix: <a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>from morning to
	night it presented the appearance of a fair. Booths and tents were erected
	for the transaction of business and the sale of refreshments, and gamblers
	with their roulette tables stationed themselves in the very middle of the
	place, and reaped a golden, or rather a paper, harvest from the throng.
	The boulevards and public gardens were forsaken; parties of pleasure took
	their walks in preference in the Place Vendôme, which became the
	fashionable lounge of the idle, as well as the general rendezvous of the
	busy. The noise was so great all day, that the chancellor, whose court was
	situated in the square, complained to the regent and the municipality,
	that he could not hear the advocates. Law, when applied to, expressed his
	willingness to aid in the removal of the nuisance, and for this purpose
	entered into a treaty with the Prince de Carignan for the Hôtel de
	Soissons, which had a garden of several acres in the rear. A bargain <a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>was
	concluded, by which Law became the purchaser of the hotel at an enormous
	price, the prince reserving to himself the magnificent gardens as a new
	source of profit. They contained some fine statues and several fountains,
	and were altogether laid out with much taste. As soon as Law was installed
	in his new abode, an edict was published, forbidding all persons to buy or
	sell stock any where but in the gardens of the Hôtel de Soissons. In the
	midst, among the trees, about five hundred small tents and pavilions were
	erected, for the convenience of the stock-jobbers. Their various colours,
	the gay ribands and banners which floated from them, the busy crowds which
	passed continually in and out—the incessant hum of voices, the noise, the
	music, and the strange mixture of business and pleasure on the
	countenances of the throng, all combined to give the place an air of
	enchantment that quite enraptured the Parisians. The Prince de Carignan
	made enormous profits while the delusion lasted. Each tent was let at the
	rate of five hundred livres a month; and, as there were at least five
	hundred of them, his monthly revenue from this source alone must have
	amounted to 250,000 livres, or upwards of 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:363px;">

		<p class="caption">HOTEL DE SOISSONS.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The honest old soldier, Marshal Villars, was so vexed to see the folly
	which had smitten his countrymen, that he never could speak with temper on
	the subject. Passing one day through the Place Vendôme in his carriage,
	the choleric gentleman was so annoyed at the infatuation of the people,
	that he abruptly ordered his coachman to stop, and, putting his head out
	of the carriage window, harangued them for full half an hour on their
	“disgusting avarice.” This was <a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>not a very wise proceeding on his part.
	Hisses and shouts of laughter resounded from every side, and jokes without
	number were aimed at him. There being at last strong symptoms that
	something more tangible was flying through the air in the direction of his
	head, the marshal was glad to drive on. He never again repeated the
	experiment.</p>

	<p>Two sober, quiet, and philosophic men of letters, M. de la Motte and the
	Abbé Terrason, congratulated each other, that they, at least, were free
	from this strange infatuation. A few days afterwards, as the worthy abbé
	was coming out of the Hôtel de Soissons, whither he had gone to buy shares
	in the Mississippi, whom should he see but his friend La Motte entering
	for the same purpose. “Ha!” said the abbé smiling, “is that <em>you</em>?” “Yes,”
	said La Motte, pushing past him as fast as he was able; “and can that be
	<em>you</em>?” The next time the two scholars met, they talked of philosophy, of
	science, and of religion, but neither had courage for a long time to
	breathe one syllable about the Mississippi. At last, when it was
	mentioned, they agreed that a man ought never to swear against his doing
	any one thing, and that there was no sort of extravagance of which even a
	wise man was not capable.</p>

	<p>During this time, Law, the new Plutus, had become all at once the most
	important personage of the state. The ante-chambers of the regent were
	forsaken by the courtiers, Peers, judges, and bishops thronged to the
	Hôtel de Soissons; officers of the army and navy, ladies of title and
	fashion, and every one to whom hereditary rank or public employ gave a
	claim to precedence, were to be found waiting in his ante-chambers to beg
	for a portion of his India stock. Law was so pestered that he was unable
	to see one-tenth part of the applicants, and every manœuvre that
	ingenuity could suggest was employed to gain access to him. Peers, whose
	dignity would have been outraged if the regent had made them wait half an
	hour for an interview, were content to wait six hours for the chance of
	seeing Monsieur Law. Enormous fees were paid to his servants, if they
	would merely announce their names. Ladies of rank employed the
	blandishments of their smiles for the same object; but many of them came
	day after day for a fortnight before they could obtain an audience. When
	Law accepted an invitation, he was sometimes so surrounded by ladies, all
	asking to have their names put down in his lists as shareholders in the
	new stock, that, in spite of his well-known and habitual gallantry, he was
	obliged to tear himself away <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par force</em>. The most ludicrous stratagems
	were employed to have an opportunity of speaking to him. One lady, who had
	striven in vain during several days, gave up in despair all attempts to
	see him at his own house, but ordered her <a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>coachman to keep a strict watch
	whenever she was out in her carriage, and if he saw Mr. Law coming, to
	drive against a post and upset her. The coachman promised obedience, and
	for three days the lady was driven incessantly through the town, praying
	inwardly for the opportunity to be overturned. At last she espied Mr. Law,
	and, pulling the string, called out to the coachman, “Upset us now! for
	God’s sake, upset us now!” The coachman drove against a post, the lady
	screamed, the coach was overturned, and Law, who had seen the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accident</em>,
	hastened to the spot to render assistance. The cunning dame was led into
	the Hôtel de Soissons, where she soon thought it advisable to recover from
	her fright, and, after apologising to Mr. Law, confessed her stratagem.
	Law smiled, and entered the lady in his books as the purchaser of a
	quantity of India stock. Another story is told of a Madame de Boucha, who,
	knowing that Mr. Law was at dinner at a certain house, proceeded thither
	in her carriage, and gave the alarm of fire. The company started from
	table, and Law among the rest; but, seeing one lady making all haste into
	the house towards <a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>him, while every body else was scampering away, he
	suspected the trick, and ran off in another direction.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:315px;">
		<a href="images/image09.png"><img src="images/th_image09.png" alt="A man helps a woman from a wrecked carriage." id="image09" width="315" height="340" /></a>
	</div>

	<p>Many other anecdotes are related, which even though they may be a little
	exaggerated, are nevertheless worth preserving, as shewing the spirit of
	that singular period.<a href="#fn7" id="fnm7" title="The curious reader..." class="fnmarker">7</a> The regent was one day mentioning, in the
	presence of D’Argenson, the Abbé Dubois, and some other persons, that he
	was desirous of deputing some lady, of the rank at least of a duchess, to
	attend upon his daughter at Modena; “but,” added he, “I do not exactly
	know where to find one.” “No!” replied one, in affected surprise; “I can
	tell you where to find every duchess in France: you have only to go to Mr.
	Law’s; you will see them every one in his ante-chamber.”</p>

	<p>M. de Chirac, a celebrated physician, had bought stock at an unlucky
	period, and was very anxious to sell out. Stock, however, continued to
	fall for two or three days, much to his alarm. His mind was filled with
	the subject, when he was suddenly called upon to attend a lady who
	imagined herself unwell. He arrived, was shewn up stairs, and felt the
	lady’s pulse. “It falls! it falls! good God! it falls continually!” said
	he musingly, while the lady looked up in his face all anxiety for his
	opinion. “Oh, M. de Chirac,” said she, starting to her feet and ringing
	the bell for assistance; “I am dying! I am dying! it falls! it falls! it
	falls!” “What falls?” inquired the doctor in amazement. “My pulse! my
	pulse!” said the lady; “I must be dying.” “Calm your apprehensions, my
	dear madam,” said M. de Chirac; “I was speaking of the stocks. The truth
	is, I have been a great loser, and my mind is so disturbed, I hardly know
	what I have been saying.”</p>

	<p>The price of shares sometimes rose ten or twenty per cent in the course of
	a few hours, and many persons in the humbler walks of life, who had risen
	poor in the morning, went to bed in affluence. An extensive holder of
	stock, being taken ill, sent his servant to sell two hundred and fifty
	shares, at eight thousand livres each, the price at which they were then
	quoted. The servant went, and, on his arrival in the Jardin de Soissons,
	found that in the interval the price had risen to ten thousand livres. The
	difference of two thousand livres on the two hundred and fifty shares,
	amounting to 500,000 livres, or 20,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling, he very coolly
	transferred to his own use, and giving the remainder to his master, set
	out the same evening for another country. Law’s coachman in a very short
	time made money enough <a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>to set up a carriage of his own, and requested
	permission to leave his service. Law, who esteemed the man, begged of him
	as a favour, that he would endeavour, before he went, to find a substitute
	as good as himself. The coachman consented, and in the evening brought two
	of his former comrades, telling Mr. Law to choose between them, and he
	would take the other. Cookmaids and footmen were now and then as lucky,
	and, in the full-blown pride of their easily-acquired wealth, made the
	most ridiculous mistakes. Preserving the language and manners of their
	old, with the finery of their new station, they afforded continual
	subjects for the pity of the sensible, the contempt of the sober, and the
	laughter of every body. But the folly and meanness of the higher ranks of
	society were still more disgusting. One instance alone, related by the
	Duke de St. Simon, will shew the unworthy avarice which infected the whole
	of society. A man of the name of André, without character or education,
	had, by a series of well-timed speculations in Mississippi bonds, gained
	enormous wealth in an incredibly short space of time. As St. Simon
	expresses it, “he had amassed mountains of gold.” As he became rich, he
	grew ashamed of the lowness of his birth, and anxious above all things to
	be allied to nobility. He had a daughter, an infant only three years of
	age, and he opened a negotiation with the aristocratic and needy family of
	D’Oyse, that this child should, upon certain conditions, marry a member of
	that house. The Marquis D’Oyse, to his shame, consented, and promised to
	marry her himself on her attaining the age of twelve, if the father would
	pay him down the sum of a hundred thousand crowns, and twenty thousand
	livres every year until the celebration of the marriage. The marquis was
	himself in his thirty-third year. This scandalous bargain was duly signed
	and sealed, the stockjobber furthermore agreeing to settle upon his
	daughter, on the marriage-day, a fortune of several millions. The Duke of
	Brancas, the head of the family, was present throughout the negotiation,
	and shared in all the profits. St. Simon, who treats the matter with the
	levity becoming what he thought so good a joke, adds, “that people did not
	spare their animadversions on this beautiful marriage,” and further
	informs us, “that the project fell to the ground some months afterwards by
	the overthrow of Law, and the ruin of the ambitious Monsieur André.” It
	would appear, however, that the noble family never had the honesty to
	return the hundred thousand crowns.</p>

	<p>Amid events like these, which, humiliating though they be, partake largely
	of the ludicrous, others occurred of a more serious nature. Robberies in
	the streets were of daily occurrence, in consequence of the immense sums,
	in paper, which people carried about with them. <a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>Assassinations were also
	frequent. One case in particular fixed the attention of the whole of
	France, not only on account of the enormity of the offence, but of the
	rank and high connexions of the criminal.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:312px;">
		<a href="images/image10.png"><img src="images/th_image10.png" alt="Two men knife a third." id="image10" width="312" height="390" /></a>
	</div>

	<p>The Count d’Horn, a younger brother of the Prince d’Horn, and related to
	the noble families of D’Aremberg, De Ligne, and De Montmorency, was a
	young man of dissipated character, extravagant to a degree, and
	unprincipled as he was extravagant. In connexion with two other young men
	as reckless as himself, named Mille, a Piedmontese captain, and one
	Destampes, or Lestang, a Fleming, he formed a design to rob a very rich
	broker, who was known, unfortunately for himself, to carry great sums
	about his person. The count pretended a desire to purchase of him a number
	of shares in the Company <a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>of the Indies, and for that purpose appointed to
	meet him in a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</em>, or low public-house, in the neighbourhood of the
	Place Vendôme. The unsuspecting broker was punctual to his appointment; so
	were the Count d’Horn and his two associates, whom he introduced as his
	particular friends. After a few moments’ conversation, the Count d’Horn
	suddenly sprang upon his victim, and stabbed him three times in the breast
	with a poniard. The man fell heavily to the ground, and, while the count
	was employed in rifling his portfolio of bonds in the Mississippi and
	Indian schemes to the amount of one hundred thousand crowns, Mille, the
	Piedmontese, stabbed the unfortunate broker again and again, to make sure
	of his death, But the broker did not fall without a struggle, and his
	cries brought the people of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</em> to his assistance. Lestang, the
	other assassin, who had been set to keep watch at a staircase, sprang from
	a window and escaped; but Mille and the Count d’Horn were seized in the
	very act.</p>

	<p>This crime, committed in open day, and in so public a place as a
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</em>, filled Paris with consternation. The trial of the assassins
	commenced on the following day; and the evidence being so clear, they were
	both found guilty, and condemned, to be broken alive on the wheel. The
	noble relatives of the Count d’Horn absolutely blocked up the
	ante-chambers of the regent, praying for mercy on the misguided youth, and
	alleging that he was insane. The regent avoided them as long as possible,
	being determined that, in a case so atrocious, justice should take its
	course. But the importunity of these influential suitors was not to be
	overcome so silently; and they at last forced themselves into the presence
	of the regent, and prayed him to save their house the shame of a public
	execution. They hinted that the Princes d’Horn were allied to the
	illustrious family of Orleans; and added, that the regent himself would be
	disgraced if a kinsman of his should die by the hands of a common
	executioner. The regent, to his credit, was proof against all their
	solicitations, and replied to their last argument in the words of
	Corneille:</p>

	<blockquote lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p>“Le crime fait la honte, et non pas l’échafaud:”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">adding, that whatever shame there might be in the punishment he would very
	willingly share with the other relatives. Day after day they renewed their
	entreaties, but always with the same result. At last they thought, that if
	they could interest the Duke de St. Simon in their favour—a man, for whom
	the regent felt sincere esteem—they might succeed in their object. The
	duke, a thorough aristocrat, was as shocked as they were that a noble
	assassin should die by the same death as a plebeian felon, and represented
	to the regent the impolicy of making enemies of so numerous, wealthy, and
	powerful a family. <a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>He urged, too, that in Germany, where the family of
	D’Aremberg had large possessions, it was the law, that no relative of a
	person broken on the wheel could succeed to any public office or employ
	until a whole generation had passed away. For this reason, he thought the
	punishment of the guilty count might be transmuted into beheading, which
	was considered all over Europe as much less infamous. The regent was moved
	by this argument, and was about to consent, when Law, who felt peculiarly
	interested in the fate of the murdered man, confirmed him in his former
	resolution to let the law take its course.</p>

	<p>The relatives of D’Horn were now reduced to the last extremity. The Prince
	de Robec Montmorency, despairing of other methods, found means to
	penetrate into the dungeon of the criminal, and offering him a cup of
	poison, implored him to save them from disgrace. The Count d’Horn turned
	away his head, and refused to take it. Montmorency pressed him once more;
	and losing all patience at his continued refusal, turned on his heel, and
	exclaiming, “Die, then, as thou wilt, mean-spirited wretch! thou art fit
	only to perish by the hands of the hangman!” left him to his fate.</p>

	<p>D’Horn himself petitioned the regent that he might be beheaded; but Law,
	who exercised more influence over his mind than any other person, with the
	exception of the notorious Abbé Dubois, his tutor, insisted that he could
	not in justice succumb to the self-interested views of the D’Horns. The
	regent had from the first been of the same opinion; and within six days
	after the commission of their crime, D’Horn and Mille were broken on the
	wheel in the Place de Grève. The other assassin, Lestang, was never
	apprehended.</p>

	<p>This prompt and severe justice was highly pleasing to the populace of
	Paris. Even M. de Quincampoix, as they called Law, came in for a share of
	their approbation for having induced the regent to shew no favour to a
	patrician. But the number of robberies and assassinations did not
	diminish; no sympathy was shewn for rich jobbers when they were plundered.
	The general laxity of public morals, conspicuous enough before, was
	rendered still more so by its rapid pervasion of the middle classes, who
	had hitherto remained comparatively pure between the open vices of the
	class above and the hidden crimes of the class below them. The pernicious
	love of gambling diffused itself through society, and bore all public and
	nearly all private virtue before it.</p>

	<p>For a time, while confidence lasted, an impetus was given to trade which
	could not fail to be beneficial. In Paris especially the good results were
	felt. Strangers flocked into the capital from every part, bent not only
	upon making money, but on spending it. The Duchess <a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>of Orleans, mother of
	the regent, computes the increase of the population during this time, from
	the great influx of strangers from all parts of the world, at 305,000
	souls. The housekeepers were obliged to make up beds in garrets, kitchens,
	and even stables, for the accommodation of lodgers; and the town was so
	full of carriages and vehicles of every description, that they were
	obliged, in the principal streets, to drive at a foot-pace for fear of
	accidents. The looms of the country worked with unusual activity to supply
	rich laces, silks, broad-cloth, and velvets, which being paid for in
	abundant paper, increased in price four-fold. Provisions shared the
	general advance. Bread, meat, and vegetables were sold at prices greater
	than had ever before been known; while the wages of labour rose in exactly
	the same proportion. The artisan who formerly gained fifteen sous per diem
	now gained sixty. New houses were built in every direction; an illusory
	prosperity shone over the land, and so dazzled the eyes of the whole
	nation, that none could see the dark cloud on the horizon announcing the
	storm that was too rapidly approaching.</p>

	<p>Law himself, the magician whose wand had wrought so surprising a change,
	shared, of course, in the general prosperity. His wife and daughter were
	courted by the highest nobility, and their alliance sought by the heirs of
	ducal and princely houses. He bought two splendid estates in different
	parts of France, and entered into a negotiation with the family of the
	Duke de Sully for the purchase of the marquisate of Rosny. His religion
	being an obstacle to his advancement, the regent promised, if he would
	publicly conform to the Catholic faith, to make him comptroller-general of
	the finances. Law, who had no more real religion than any other professed
	gambler, readily agreed, and was confirmed by the Abbé de Tencin in the
	cathedral of Melun, in presence of a great crowd of spectators<a href="#fn8" id="fnm8" title="The following squib..." class="fnmarker">8</a>. On
	the following day he was elected honorary churchwarden of the parish of
	St. Roch, upon which occasion he made it a present of the sum of five
	hundred thousand livres. His charities, always magnificent, were not
	always so ostentatious. He gave away great sums privately, and no tale of
	real distress ever reached his ears in vain.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>At this time he was by far the most influential person of the state. The
	Duke of Orleans had so much confidence in his sagacity and the success of
	his plans, that he always consulted him upon every matter of moment. He
	was by no means unduly elevated by his prosperity, but remained the same
	simple, affable, sensible man that he had shewn himself in adversity. His
	gallantry, which was always delightful to the fair objects of it, was of a
	nature so kind, so gentlemanly, and so respectful, that not even a lover
	could have taken offence at it. If upon any occasion he shewed any
	symptoms of haughtiness, it was to the cringing nobles who lavished their
	adulation upon him till it became fulsome. He often took pleasure in
	seeing how long he could make them dance attendance upon him for a single
	favour. To such of his own countrymen as by chance visited Paris, and
	sought an interview with him, he was, on the contrary, all politeness and
	attention. When Archibald Campbell, Earl of Islay, and afterwards Duke of
	Argyle, called upon him in the Place Vendôme, he had to pass through an
	ante-chamber crowded with persons of the first distinction, all anxious to
	see the great financier, and have their names put down as first on the
	list of some new subscription. Law himself was quietly sitting in his
	library, writing a letter to the gardener at his paternal estate of
	Lauriston about the planting of some cabbages! The earl stayed for a
	considerable time, played a game of piquet with his countryman, and left
	him, charmed with his ease, good sense, and good breeding.</p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>Among the nobles who, by means of the public credulity at this time,
	gained sums sufficient to repair their ruined fortunes, may be mentioned
	the names of the Dukes de Bourbon, de Guiche, de la Force,<a href="#fn10" id="fnm10" title="The Duke de la Force..." class="fnmarker">10</a> de
	Chaulnes, and d’Antin; the Marechal d’Estrées; the Princes de Rohan, de
	Poix, and de Léon. The Duke de Bourbon, son of Louis XIV. by Madame de
	Montespan, was peculiarly fortunate in his speculations in Mississippi
	paper. He rebuilt the royal residence of Chantilly in a style of unwonted
	magnificence; and being passionately fond of horses, he erected a range of
	stables, which were long renowned throughout Europe, and imported a
	hundred and fifty of the finest racers from England to improve the breed
	in France. He bought a large extent of country in Picardy, and became
	possessed of nearly all the valuable lands lying between the Oise and the
	Somme.</p>

	<p>When fortunes such as these were gained, it is no wonder that Law should
	have been almost worshipped by the mercurial population. Never was monarch
	more flattered than he was. All the small poets and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateurs</em> of the
	day poured floods of adulation upon him. According to them, he was the
	saviour of the country, the tutelary divinity of France; wit was in all
	his words, goodness in all his looks, and wisdom in all his actions. So
	great a crowd followed his carriage whenever he went abroad, that the
	regent sent him a troop of horse as his permanent escort to clear the
	streets before him.</p>

	<p>It was remarked at this time that Paris had never before been so full of
	objects of elegance and luxury. Statues, pictures, and tapestries were
	imported in great quantities from foreign countries, and found a ready
	market. All those pretty trifles in the way of furniture and ornament
	which the French excel in manufacturing were no longer the exclusive
	playthings of the aristocracy, but were to be found in abundance in the
	houses of traders and the middle classes in general. Jewellery of the most
	costly description was brought to Paris as the most favourable mart; among
	the rest, the famous diamond bought by the regent, and called by his name,
	and which long adorned the crown of France. It was purchased for the sum
	of two millions of livres, under circumstances which shew that the regent
	was not so great a gainer as some of his subjects by the impetus which
	trade had received. When the diamond was first offered to him, he refused
	to buy it, although he desired above all things to possess it, <a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>alleging as
	his reason, that his duty to the country he governed would not allow him
	to spend so large a sum of the public money for a mere jewel. This valid
	and honourable excuse threw all the ladies of the court into alarm, and
	nothing was heard for some days but expressions of regret that so rare a
	gem should be allowed to go out of France, no private individual being
	rich enough to buy it. The regent was continually importuned about it, but
	all in vain, until the Duke de St. Simon, who with all his ability was
	something of a twaddler, undertook the weighty business. His entreaties
	being seconded by Law, the good-natured regent gave his consent, leaving
	to Law’s ingenuity to find the means to pay for it. The owner took
	security for the payment of the sum of two millions of livres within a
	stated period, receiving in the mean time the interest of five per cent
	upon that amount, and being allowed, besides, all the valuable clippings
	of the gem. St. Simon, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, relates with no little
	complacency his share in this transaction. After describing the diamond to
	be as large as a greengage, of a form nearly round, perfectly white, and
	without flaw, and weighing more than five hundred grains, he concludes
	with a chuckle, by telling the world “that he takes great credit to
	himself for having induced the regent to make so illustrious a purchase.”
	In other words, he was proud that he had induced him to sacrifice his
	duty, and buy a bauble for himself at an extravagant price out of the
	public money.</p>

	<p>Thus the system continued to flourish till the commencement of the year
	1720. The warnings of the parliament, that too great a creation of paper
	money would, sooner or later, bring the country to bankruptcy, were
	disregarded. The regent, who knew nothing whatever of the philosophy of
	finance, thought that a system which had produced such good effects could
	never be carried to excess. If five hundred millions of paper had been of
	such advantage, five hundred millions additional would be of still greater
	advantage. This was the grand error of the regent, and which Law did not
	attempt to dispel. The extraordinary avidity of the people kept up the
	delusion; and the higher the price of Indian and Mississippi stock, the
	more <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets de banque</em> were issued to keep pace with it. The edifice
	thus reared might not unaptly be compared to the gorgeous palace erected
	by Potemkin, that princely barbarian of Russia, to surprise and please his
	imperial mistress: huge blocks of ice were piled one upon another; ionic
	pillars, of chastest workmanship, in ice, formed a noble portico; and a
	dome, of the same material, shone in the sun, which had just strength
	enough to gild, but not to melt it. It glittered afar, like a palace of
	crystals and diamonds; but there came one warm breeze from the south, and
	the stately building dissolved away, till none <a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>were able even to gather up
	the fragments. So with Law and his paper system. No sooner did the breath
	of popular mistrust blow steadily upon it, than it fell to ruins, and none
	could raise it up again.</p>

	<p>The first slight alarm that was occasioned was early in 1720. The Prince
	de Conti, offended that Law should have denied him fresh shares in India
	stock, at his own price, sent to his bank to demand payment in specie of
	so enormous a quantity of notes, that three wagons were required for its
	transport. Law complained to the regent, and urged on his attention the
	mischief that would be done, if such an example found many imitators. The
	regent was but too well aware of it, and, sending for the Prince de Conti,
	ordered him, under penalty of his high displeasure, to refund to the bank
	two-thirds of the specie which he had withdrawn from it. The prince was
	forced to obey the despotic mandate. Happily for Law’s credit, De Conti
	was an unpopular man: every body condemned his meanness and cupidity, and
	agreed that Law had been hardly treated. It is strange, however, that so
	narrow an escape should not have made both Law and the regent more anxious
	to restrict their issues. Others were soon found who imitated, from
	motives of distrust, the example which had been set by De Conti in
	revenge. The more acute stockjobbers imagined justly that prices could not
	continue to rise for ever. Bourdon and La Richardière, renowned for their
	extensive operations in the funds, quietly and in small quantities at a
	time, converted their notes into specie, and sent it away to foreign
	countries. They also bought as much as they could conveniently carry of
	plate and expensive jewellery, and sent it secretly away to England or to
	Holland. Vermalet, a jobber, who sniffed the coming storm, procured gold
	and silver coin to the amount of nearly a million of livres, which he
	packed in a farmer’s cart, and covered over with hay and cow-dung. He then
	disguised himself in the dirty smock-frock, or <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blouse</em>, of a peasant, and
	drove his precious load in safety into Belgium. From thence he soon found
	means to transport it to Amsterdam.</p>

	<p>Hitherto no difficulty had been experienced by any class in procuring
	specie for their wants. But this system could not long be carried on
	without causing a scarcity. The voice of complaint was heard on every
	side, and inquiries being instituted, the cause was soon discovered. The
	council debated long on the remedies to be taken, and Law, being called on
	for his advice, was of opinion, that an edict should be published,
	depreciating the value of coin five per cent below that of paper. The
	edict was published accordingly; but failing of its intended effect, was
	followed by another, in which the depreciation was increased to ten per
	cent. The payments of the bank were at the same time restricted to one
	hundred livres in gold, and <a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>ten in silver. All these measures were
	nugatory to restore confidence in the paper, though the restriction of
	cash payments within limits so extremely narrow kept up the credit of the
	bank.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:254px;">
		<a href="images/image12.png"><img src="images/th_image12.png" alt="Law surrounded by comic figures." id="image12" width="254" height="412" /></a>
		<p class="caption">LUCIFER’S NEW ROW-BARGE.<a href="#fn11" id="fnm11" title="'Lucifer's New Row-Barge'..." class="fnmarker">11</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>Notwithstanding every effort to the contrary, the precious metals
	continued to be conveyed to England and Holland. The little coin that was
	left in the country was carefully treasured, or hidden until the scarcity
	became so great, that the operations of trade could no longer be carried
	on. In this emergency, Law hazarded the bold experiment of forbidding the
	use of specie altogether. In February <a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>1720 an edict was published, which,
	instead of restoring the credit of the paper, as was intended, destroyed
	it irrecoverably, and drove the country to the very brink of revolution.
	By this famous edict it was forbidden to any person whatever to have more
	than five hundred livres (20<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>) of coin in his possession, under pain of a
	heavy fine, and confiscation of the sums found. It was also forbidden to
	buy up jewellery, plate, and precious stones, and informers were
	encouraged to make search for offenders, by the promise of one-half the
	amount they might discover. The whole country sent up a cry of distress at
	this unheard-of tyranny. The most odious persecution daily took place. The
	privacy of families was violated by the intrusion of informers and their
	agents. The most virtuous and honest were denounced for the crime of
	having been seen with a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">louis d’or</em> in their possession. Servants
	betrayed their masters, one citizen became a spy upon his neighbour, and
	arrests and confiscations so multiplied, that the courts found a
	difficulty in getting through the immense increase of business thus
	occasioned. It was sufficient for an informer to say that he suspected any
	person of concealing money in his house, and immediately a search-warrant
	was granted. Lord Stair, the English ambassador, said, that it was now
	impossible to doubt of the sincerity of Law’s conversion to the Catholic
	religion; he had established the <em>inquisition</em>, after having given
	abundant evidence of his faith in <em>transubstantiation</em>, by turning so much
	gold into paper.</p>

	<p>Every epithet that popular hatred could suggest was showered upon the
	regent and the unhappy Law. Coin, to any amount above five hundred livres,
	was an illegal tender, and nobody would take paper if he could help it. No
	one knew to-day what his notes would be worth to-morrow. “Never,” says
	Duclos, in his <cite>Secret Memoirs of the Regency</cite>, “was seen a more
	capricious government—never was a more frantic tyranny exercised by hands
	less firm. It is inconceivable to those who were witnesses of the horrors
	of those times, and who look back upon them now as on a dream, that a
	sudden revolution did not break out—that Law and the regent did not
	perish by a tragical death. They were both held in horror, but the people
	confined themselves to complaints; a sombre and timid despair, a stupid
	consternation, had seized upon all, and men’s minds were too vile even to
	be capable of a courageous crime.” It would appear that, a one time, a
	movement of the people was organised. Seditious writings were posted up
	against the walls, and were sent, in hand-bills, to the houses of the most
	conspicuous people. One of them, given in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de la Régence</cite>,
	was to the following effect:—“Sir and madam,—This is to give you notice
	that a St. Bartholomew’s Day will be enacted again on Saturday and Sunday,
	if affairs do not <a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>alter. You are desired not to stir out, nor you, nor
	your servants. God preserve you from the flames! Give notice to your
	neighbours. Dated, Saturday, May 25th, 1720.” The immense number of spies
	with which the city was infested rendered the people mistrustful of one
	another, and beyond some trifling disturbances made in the evening by an
	insignificant group, which was soon dispersed, the peace of the capital
	was not compromised.</p>
	
	<div class="figcenter" style="width:358px;">
		<a href="images/image13.png"><img src="images/th_image13.png" alt="Villagers with picks and shovels." id="image13" width="358" height="251" /></a>
	</div>

	<p>The value of shares in the Louisiana, or Mississippi stock, had fallen
	very rapidly, and few indeed were found to believe the tales that had once
	been told of the immense wealth of that region. A last effort was
	therefore tried to restore the public confidence in the Mississippi
	project. For this purpose, a general conscription of all the poor wretches
	in Paris was made by order of government. Upwards of six thousand of the
	very refuse of the population were impressed, as if in time of war, and
	were provided with clothes and tools to be embarked for New Orleans, to
	work in the gold mines alleged to abound there. They were paraded day
	after day through the streets with their pikes and shovels, and then sent
	off in small detachments to the out-ports to be shipped for America.
	Two-thirds of them never reached their destination, but dispersed
	themselves over the country, sold their tools for what they could get, and
	returned to their old course of life. In less than three weeks afterwards,
	one-half of them were to be found again in Paris. The manœuvre, however,
	caused a <a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>trifling advance in Mississippi stock. Many persons of
	superabundant gullibility believed that operations had begun in earnest in
	the new Golconda, and that gold and silver ingots would again be found in
	France.</p>

	<p>In a constitutional monarchy some surer means would have been found for
	the restoration of public credit. In England, at a subsequent period, when
	a similar delusion had brought on similar distress, how different were the
	measures taken to repair the evil; but in France, unfortunately, the
	remedy was left to the authors of the mischief. The arbitrary will of the
	regent, which endeavoured to extricate the country, only plunged it deeper
	into the mire. All payments were ordered to be made in paper, and between
	the 1st of February and the end of May, notes were fabricated to the
	amount of upwards of 1500 millions of livres, or 60,000,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling.
	But the alarm once sounded, no art could make the people feel the
	slightest confidence in paper which was not exchangeable into metal. M.
	Lambert, the president of the parliament of Paris, told the regent to his
	face that he would rather have a hundred thousand livres in gold or silver
	than five millions in the notes of his bank. When such was the general
	feeling, the superabundant issues of paper but increased the evil, by
	rendering still more enormous the disparity between the amount of specie
	and notes in circulation. Coin, which it was the object of the regent to
	depreciate, rose in value on every fresh attempt to diminish it. In
	February, it was judged advisable that the Royal Bank should be
	incorporated with the Company of the Indies. An edict to that effect was
	published and registered by the parliament. The state remained the
	guarantee for the notes of the bank, and no more were to be issued without
	an order in council. All the profits of the bank, since the time it had
	been taken out of Law’s hands and made a national institution, were given
	over by the regent to the Company of the Indies. This measure had the
	effect of raising for a short time the value of the Louisiana and other
	shares of the company, but it failed in placing public credit on any
	permanent basis.</p>

	<p>A council of state was held in the beginning of May, at which Law,
	D’Argenson (his colleague in the administration of the finances), and all
	the ministers were present. It was then computed that the total amount of
	notes in circulation was 2600 millions of livres, while the coin in the
	country was not quite equal to half that amount. It was evident to the
	majority of the council that some plan must be adopted to equalise the
	currency. Some proposed that the notes should be reduced to the value of
	the specie, while others proposed that the nominal value of the specie
	should be raised till it was on an equality with the paper. Law is said to
	have opposed both these projects, <a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>but failing in suggesting any other, it
	was agreed that the notes should be depreciated one half. On the 21st of
	May, an edict was accordingly issued, by which it was decreed that the
	shares of the Company of the Indies, and the notes of the bank, should
	gradually diminish in value, till at the end of a year they should only
	pass current for one-half of their nominal worth. The parliament refused
	to register the edict—the greatest outcry was excited, and the state of
	the country became so alarming, that, as the only means of preserving
	tranquillity, the council of the regency was obliged to stultify its own
	proceedings, by publishing within seven days another edict, restoring the
	notes to their original value.</p>

	<p>On the same day (the 27th of May) the bank stopped payment in specie. Law
	and D’Argenson were both dismissed from the ministry. The weak,
	vacillating, and cowardly regent threw the blame of all the mischief upon
	Law, who, upon presenting himself at the Palais Royal, was refused
	admittance. At nightfall, however, he was sent for, and admitted into the
	palace by a secret door,<a href="#fn12" id="fnm12" title="Duclos..." class="fnmarker">12</a> when the regent endeavoured to console him,
	and made all manner of excuses for the severity with which in public he
	had been compelled to treat him. So capricious was his conduct, that, two
	days afterwards, he took him publicly to the opera, where he sat in the
	royal box alongside of the regent, who treated him with marked
	consideration in face of all the people. But such was the hatred against
	Law that the experiment had well nigh proved fatal to him. The mob
	assailed his carriage with stones just as he was entering his own door;
	and if the coachman had not made a sudden jerk into the court-yard, and
	the domestics closed the gate immediately, he would, in all probability,
	have been dragged out and torn to pieces. On the following day, his wife
	and daughter were also assailed by the mob as they were returning in their
	carriage from the races. When the regent was informed of these occurrences
	he sent Law a strong detachment of Swiss guards, who were stationed night
	and day in the court of his residence. The public indignation at last
	increased so much, that Law, finding his own house, even with this guard,
	insecure, took refuge in the Palais Royal, in the apartments of the
	regent.</p>

	<p>The Chancellor, D’Aguesseau, who had been dismissed in 1718 for his
	opposition to the projects of Law, was now recalled to aid in the
	restoration of credit. The regent acknowledged too late, that he had
	treated with unjustifiable harshness and mistrust one of the ablest, and
	perhaps the sole honest public man of that corrupt period. He had retired
	ever since his disgrace to his country house at Fresnes, where, in the
	midst of severe but delightful philosophic studies, he <a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>had forgotten the
	intrigues of an unworthy court. Law himself, and the Chevalier de
	Conflans, a gentleman of the regent’s household, were despatched in a
	post-chaise with orders to bring the ex-chancellor to Paris along with
	them. D’Aguesseau consented to render what assistance he could, contrary
	to the advice of his friends, who did not approve that he should accept
	any recal to office of which Law was the bearer. On his arrival in Paris,
	five counsellors of the parliament were admitted to confer with the
	Commissary of Finance; and on the 1st of June an order was published
	abolishing the law which made it criminal to amass coin to the amount of
	more than five hundred livres. Every one was permitted to have as much
	specie as he pleased. In order that the bank-notes might be withdrawn,
	twenty-five millions of new notes were created, on the security of the
	revenues of the city of Paris, at two-and-a-half per cent. The bank-notes
	withdrawn were publicly burned in front of the Hôtel de Ville. The new
	notes were principally of the value of ten livres each; and on the 10th of
	June the bank was re-opened, with a sufficiency of silver coin to give in
	change for them.</p>
	
	<div class="figleft" style="width:174px;">
		<a href="images/image14.png"><img src="images/th_image14.png" alt="A head-and-shoulders portait." id="image14" width="174" height="166" /></a>
		<p class="caption">D’AGUESSEAU.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>These measures were productive of considerable advantage. All the
	population of Paris hastened to the bank to get coin for their small
	notes; and silver becoming scarce, they were paid in copper. Very few
	complained that this was too heavy, although poor fellows might be
	continually seen toiling and sweating along the streets, laden with more
	than they could comfortably carry, in the shape of change for fifty
	livres. The crowds around the bank were so great, that hardly a day passed
	that some one was not pressed to death. On the 9th of July, the multitude
	was so dense and clamorous that the guards stationed at the entrance of
	the Mazarin Gardens closed the gate and refused to admit any more. The
	crowd became incensed, and flung stones through the railings upon the
	soldiers. The latter, incensed in their turn, threatened to fire upon the
	people.  At that instant one of them was hit by a stone, and, taking up
	his piece, he fired into the crowd. One man fell dead immediately, and
	another was severely wounded. It was every instant expected that a general
	attack would have been commenced upon the bank; but the gates of <a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>the
	Mazarin Gardens being opened to the crowd, who saw a whole troop of
	soldiers, with their bayonets fixed ready to receive them, they contented
	themselves by giving vent to their indignation in groans and hisses.</p>

	<p>Eight days afterwards the concourse of people was so tremendous that
	fifteen persons were squeezed to death at the doors of the bank. The
	people were so indignant that they took three of the bodies on stretchers
	before them, and proceeded, to the number of seven or eight thousand, to
	the gardens of the Palais Royal, that they might shew the regent the
	misfortunes that he and Law had brought upon the country. Law’s coachman,
	who was sitting at the box of his master’s carriage, in the court-yard of
	the palace, happened to have more zeal than discretion, and, not liking
	that the mob should abuse his master, he said, loud enough to be overheard
	by several persons, that they were all blackguards, and deserved to be
	hanged. The mob immediately set upon him, and thinking that Law was in the
	carriage, broke it to pieces. The imprudent coachman narrowly escaped with
	his life. No further mischief was done; a body of troops making their
	appearance, the crowd quietly dispersed, after an assurance had been given
	by the regent that the three bodies they had brought to shew him should be
	decently buried at his own expense. The parliament was sitting at the time
	of this uproar, and the president took upon himself to go out and see what
	was the matter. On his return he informed the councillors that Law’s
	carriage had been broken by the mob. All the members rose simultaneously,
	and expressed their joy by a loud shout, while one man, more zealous in
	his hatred than the rest, exclaimed, “<span class="reverse_emphasis">And Law himself, is <em>he</em> torn to
	pieces?</span>”<a href="#fn13" id="fnm13" title="The Duchess of Orleans..." class="fnmarker">13</a></p>

	<p>Much, undoubtedly, depended on the credit of the Company of the Indies,
	which was answerable for so great a sum to the nation. It was therefore
	suggested in the council of the ministry, that any privileges which could
	be granted to enable it to fulfil its engagements, would be productive of
	the best results. With this end in view, it was proposed that the
	exclusive privilege of all maritime commerce should be secured to it, and
	an edict to that effect was published. But it was unfortunately forgotten
	that by such a measure all the merchants of the country would be ruined.
	The idea of such an immense privilege was generally scouted by the nation,
	and petition on petition was presented to the parliament that they would
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>refuse to register the decree. They refused accordingly, and the regent,
	remarking that they did nothing but fan the flame of sedition, exiled them
	to Blois. At the intercession of D’Aguesseau, the place of banishment was
	changed to Pontoise, and thither accordingly the councillors repaired,
	determined to set the regent at defiance. They made every arrangement for
	rendering their temporary exile as agreeable as possible. The president
	gave the most elegant suppers, to which he invited all the gayest and
	wittiest company of Paris. Every night there was a concert and ball for
	the ladies. The usually grave and solemn judges and councillors joined in
	cards and other diversions, leading for several weeks a life of the most
	extravagant pleasure, for no other purpose than to shew the regent of how
	little consequence they deemed their banishment, and that, when they
	willed it, they could make Pontoise a pleasanter residence than Paris.</p>

	<p>Of all the nations in the world the French are the most renowned for
	singing over their grievances. Of that country it has been remarked with
	some truth, that its whole history may be traced in its songs. When Law,
	by the utter failure of his best-laid plans, rendered himself obnoxious,
	satire of course seized hold upon him; and while caricatures of his person
	appeared in all the shops, the streets resounded with songs, in which
	neither he nor the regent was spared. Many of these songs were far from
	decent; and one of them in particular counselled the application of all
	his notes to the most ignoble use to which paper can be applied. But the
	following, preserved in the letters of the Duchess of Orleans, was the
	best and the most popular, and was to be heard for months in all the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrefours</em> in Paris. The application of the chorus is happy enough:</p>

	<p>The following epigram is of the same date:</p>

	<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p><em>Lundi</em>, j’achetai des actions;</p>
		<p><em>Mardi</em>, je gagnai des millions;</p>
		<p><em>Mercredi</em>, j’arrangeai mon ménage,</p>
		<p><em>Jeudi</em>, je pris un équipage,</p>

		<p><em>Et Samedi</em>, à l’hôpital.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Among the caricatures that were abundantly published, and that shewed as
	plainly as graver matters, that the nation had awakened to a sense of its
	folly, was one, a fac-simile of which is preserved in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de la
	Régence</cite>. It was thus described by its author: “The ‘Goddess of Shares,’
	in her triumphal car, driven by the Goddess of Folly. Those who are
	drawing the car are impersonations of the Mississippi, with his wooden
	leg, the South Sea, the Bank of England, the Company of the West of
	Senegal, and of various assurances. Lest the car should not roll fast
	enough, the agents of these companies, known by their long fox-tails and
	their cunning looks, turn round the spokes of the wheels, upon which are
	marked the names of the several stocks and their value, sometimes high and
	sometimes low, according to the turns of the wheel. Upon the ground are
	the merchandise, day-books and ledgers of legitimate commerce, crushed
	under the chariot of Folly. Behind is an immense crowd of persons, of all
	ages, sexes, and conditions, clamoring after Fortune, and fighting with
	each other to get a portion of the shares which she distributes so
	bountifully among them. In the clouds sits a demon, blowing bubbles of
	soap, which are also the objects of the admiration and cupidity of the
	crowd, who jump upon one another’s backs to reach them ere they burst.
	Right in the pathway of the car, and blocking up the passage, stands a
	large building, <a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>with three doors, through one of which it must pass, if it
	proceeds farther, and all the crowd along with it. Over the first door are
	the words, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôpital des Foux</em>,’ over the second, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôpital des Malades</em>,’
	and over the third, ‘<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôpital des Gueux</em>.’” Another caricature represented
	Law sitting in a large cauldron, boiling over the flames of popular
	madness, surrounded by an impetuous multitude, who were pouring all their
	gold and silver into it, and receiving gladly in exchange the bits of
	paper which he distributed among them by handfuls.</p>

	<p>While this excitement lasted, Law took good care not to expose himself
	unguarded in the streets. Shut up in the apartments of the regent, he was
	secure from all attack; and whenever he ventured abroad, it was either
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">incognito</em>, or in one of the royal carriages, with a powerful escort. An
	amusing anecdote is recorded of the detestation in which he was held by
	the people, and the ill-treatment he would have met had he fallen into
	their hands. A gentleman of the name of Boursel was passing in his
	carriage down the Rue St. Antoine, when his farther progress was stayed by
	a hackney-coach that had blocked up the road. M. Boursel’s servant called
	impatiently to the hackney-coachman to get out of the way, and, on his
	refusal, struck him a blow on the face. A crowd was soon drawn together by
	the disturbance, and M. Boursel got out of the carriage to restore order.
	The hackney-coachman, imagining that he had now another assailant,
	bethought him of an expedient to rid himself of both, and called out as
	loudly as he was able, “Help! help! murder! murder! Here are Law and his
	servant going to kill me! Help! help!” At this cry the people came out of
	their shops, armed with sticks and other weapons, while the mob gathered
	stones to inflict summary vengeance upon the supposed financier. Happily
	for M. Boursel and his servant, the door of the church of the Jesuits
	stood wide open, and, seeing the fearful odds against them, they rushed
	towards it with all speed. They reached the altar, pursued by the people,
	and would have been ill-treated even there, if, finding the door open
	leading to the sacristy, they had not sprang through, and closed it after
	them. The mob were then persuaded to leave the church by the alarmed and
	indignant priests, and finding M. Boursel’s carriage still in the streets,
	they vented their ill-will against it, and did it considerable damage.</p>

	<p>The twenty-five millions secured on the municipal revenues of the city of
	Paris, bearing so low an interest as two and a half per cent, were not
	very popular among the large holders of Mississippi stock. The conversion
	of the securities was, therefore, a work of considerable difficulty; for
	many preferred to retain the falling paper <a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>of Law’s Company, in the hope
	that a favourable turn might take place. On the 15th of August, with a
	view to hasten the conversion, an edict was passed, declaring that all
	notes for sums between one thousand and ten thousand livres, should not
	pass current, except for the purchase of annuities and bank accounts, or
	for the payment of instalments still due on the shares of the company.</p>

	<p>In October following another edict was passed, depriving these notes of
	all value whatever after the month of November next ensuing. The
	management of the mint, the farming of the revenue, and all the other
	advantages and privileges of the India, or Mississippi Company, were taken
	from them, and they were reduced to a mere private company. This was the
	death-blow to the whole system, which had now got into the hands of its
	enemies. Law had lost all influence in the Council of Finance, and the
	company, being despoiled of its immunities, could no longer hold out the
	shadow of a prospect of being able to fulfil its engagements. All those
	suspected of illegal profits at the time the public delusion was at its
	height, were sought out and amerced in heavy fines. It was previously
	ordered that a list of the original proprietors should be made out, and
	that such persons as still retained their shares should place them in
	deposit with the company, and that those who had neglected to complete the
	shares for which they had put down their names, should now purchase them
	of the company, at the rate of 13,500 livres for each share of 500 livres.
	Rather than submit to pay this enormous sum for stock which was actually
	at a discount, the shareholders packed up all their portable effects, and
	endeavoured to find a refuge in foreign countries. Orders were immediately
	issued to the authorities at the ports and frontiers, to apprehend all
	travellers who sought to leave the kingdom, and keep them in custody,
	until it was ascertained whether they had any plate or jewellery with
	them, or were concerned in the late stock-jobbing. Against such few as
	escaped, the punishment of death was recorded, while the most arbitrary
	proceedings were instituted against those who remained.</p>

	<p>Law himself, in a moment of despair, determined to leave a country where
	his life was no longer secure. He at first only demanded permission to
	retire from Paris to one of his country-seats—a permission which the
	regent cheerfully granted. The latter was much affected at the unhappy
	turn affairs had taken, but his faith continued unmoved in the truth and
	efficacy of Law’s financial system. His eyes were opened to his own
	errors; and during the few remaining years of his life he constantly
	longed for an opportunity of again establishing the system upon a securer
	basis. At Law’s last interview with the prince, he is reported to have
	said,—“I confess that I have <a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>committed many faults. I committed them
	because I am a man, and all men are liable to error; but I declare to you
	most solemnly that none of them proceeded from wicked or dishonest
	motives, and that nothing of the kind will be found in the whole course of
	my conduct.”</p>

	</div>

	<p>Two or three days after his departure the regent sent him a very kind
	letter, permitting him to leave the kingdom whenever he pleased, and
	stating that he had ordered his passports to be made ready. He at the same
	time offered him any sum of money he might require. Law respectfully
	declined the money, and set out for Brussels in a post-chaise belonging to
	Madame de Prie, the mistress of the Duke of Bourbon, escorted by six
	horse-guards. From thence he proceeded to Venice, where he remained for
	some months, the object of the greatest curiosity to the people, who
	believed him to be the possessor <a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>of enormous wealth. No opinion, however,
	could be more erroneous. With more generosity than could have been
	expected from a man who during the greatest part of his life had been a
	professed gambler, he had refused to enrich himself at the expense of a
	ruined nation. During the height of the popular frenzy for Mississippi
	stock, he had never doubted of the final success of his projects in making
	France the richest and most powerful nation of Europe. He invested all his
	gains in the purchase of landed property in France—a sure proof of his
	own belief in the stability of his schemes. He had hoarded no plate or
	jewellery, and sent no money, like the dishonest jobbers, to foreign
	countries. His all, with the exception of one diamond, worth about five or
	six thousand pounds sterling, was invested in the French soil; and when he
	left that country, he left it almost a beggar. This fact alone ought to
	rescue his memory from the charge of knavery, so often and so unjustly
	brought against him.</p>

	<p>As soon as his departure was known, all his estates and his valuable
	library were confiscated. Among the rest, an annuity of 200,000 livres
	(8000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling) on the lives of his wife and children, which had been
	purchased for five millions of livres, was forfeited, notwithstanding that
	a special edict, drawn up for the purpose in the days of his prosperity,
	had expressly declared that it should never be confiscated for any cause
	whatever. Great discontent existed among the people that Law had been
	suffered to escape. The mob and the parliament would have been pleased to
	have seen him hanged. The few who had not suffered by the commercial
	revolution rejoiced that the <em>quack</em> had left the country; but all those
	(and they were by far the most numerous class) whose fortunes were
	implicated regretted that his intimate knowledge of the distress of the
	country, and of the causes that had led to it, had not been rendered more
	available in discovering a remedy.</p>

	<p>At a meeting of the Council of Finance and the General Council of the
	Regency, documents were laid upon the table, from which it appeared that
	the amount of notes in circulation was 2700 millions. The regent was
	called upon to explain how it happened that there was a discrepancy
	between the dates at which these issues were made and those of the edicts
	by which they were authorised. He might have safely taken the whole blame
	upon himself, but he preferred that an absent man should bear a share of
	it; and he therefore stated that Law, upon his own authority, had issued
	1200 millions of notes at different times, and that he (the regent),
	seeing that the thing had been irrevocably done, had screened Law by
	antedating the decrees of the council which authorised the augmentation.
	It would have been more to his credit if he had told the whole truth while
	he was <a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>about it, and acknowledged that it was mainly through his
	extravagance and impatience that Law had been induced to overstep the
	bounds of safe speculation. It was also ascertained that the national
	debt, on the 1st of January 1721, amounted to upwards of 3100 millions of
	livres, or more than 124,000,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling, the interest upon which was
	3,196,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> A commission, or <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visa</em>, was forthwith appointed to examine
	into all the securities of the state creditors, who were to be divided
	into five classes; the first four comprising those who had purchased their
	securities with real effects, and, the latter comprising those who could
	give no proofs that the transactions they had entered into were real and
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</em>. The securities of the latter were ordered to be destroyed,
	while those of the first four classes were subjected to a most rigid and
	jealous scrutiny. The result of the labours of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visa</em>, was a report,
	in which they counselled the reduction of the interest upon these
	securities to fifty-six millions of livres. They justified, this, advice
	by a statement of the various acts of peculation and extortion which they
	had discovered; and an edict to that effect was accordingly published and
	duly registered by the parliaments of the kingdom.</p>

	<div class="figleft" style="width:184px;">

		<p class="caption">D’ARGENSON.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Another tribunal was afterwards established, under the title of the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambre de l’Arsenal</em>, which took cognisance of all the malversations
	committed in the financial departments of the government, during the late
	unhappy period. A Master of Requests, named Falhonet, together with the
	Abbé Clement, and two clerks in their employ, had been concerned in divers
	acts of peculation to the amount of upwards of a million of livres. The
	first two were sentenced to be beheaded, and the latter to be hanged; but
	their punishment was afterwards commuted into imprisonment for life in the
	Bastille. Numerous other acts of dishonesty were discovered, and punished,
	by fine and imprisonment.</p>

	<p>D’Argenson shared with Law and the regent the unpopularity which had
	alighted upon all those concerned in the Mississippi madness. He was
	dismissed from his post of Chancellor to make room for D’Aguesseau; but he
	retained the title of Keeper of the Seals, and <a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>was allowed to attend the
	councils whenever he pleased. He thought it better, however, to withdraw
	from Paris, and live for a time a life of seclusion at his country-seat.
	But he was not formed for retirement; and becoming moody and discontented,
	he aggravated a disease under which he had long laboured, and died in less
	than a twelve-month. The populace of Paris so detested him, that they
	carried their hatred even to his grave. As his funeral procession passed
	to the church of St. Nicholas du Chardonneret, the burying-place of his
	family, it was beset by a riotous mob, and his two sons, who were
	following as chief mourners, were obliged to drive as fast as they were
	able down a by-street to escape personal violence.</p>

	<p>As regards Law, he for some time entertained a hope that he should be
	recalled to France, to aid in establishing its credit upon a firmer basis.
	The death of the regent in 1723, who expired suddenly as he was sitting by
	the fireside conversing with his mistress, the Duchess de Phalaris,
	deprived him of that hope, and he was reduced to lead his former life of
	gambling. He was more than once obliged to pawn his diamond, the sole
	remnant of his vast wealth, but successful play generally enabled him to
	redeem it. Being persecuted by his creditors at Rome, he proceeded to
	Copenhagen, where he received permission from the English ministry to
	reside in his native country, his pardon for the murder of Mr. Wilson
	having been sent over to him in 1719. He was brought over in the admiral’s
	ship—a circumstance which gave occasion for a short debate in the House
	of Lords. Earl Coningsby complained that a man who had renounced both his
	country and his religion, should have been treated with such honour, and
	expressed his belief that his presence in England, at a time when the
	people were so bewildered by the nefarious practices of the South-Sea
	directors, would be attended with no little danger. He gave notice of a
	motion on the subject; but it was allowed to drop, no other member of the
	House having the slightest participation in his lordship’s fears. Law
	remained for about four years in England, and then proceeded to Venice,
	where he died in 1729, in very embarrassed circumstances. The following
	epitaph was written at the time:</p>

	<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p>“Ci gît cet Ecossais célébre,</p>
		<p class="i2">Ce calculateur sans égal,</p>
		<p>Qui, par les régles de l’algébre,</p>
		<p class="i2">A mis la France à l’hôpital.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>His brother, William Law, who had been concerned with him in the
	administration both of the bank and the Louisiana Company, was imprisoned
	in the Bastille for alleged malversation, but no guilt was ever proved
	against him. He was liberated after fifteen months, and <a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>became the founder
	of a family, which is still known in France under the title of Marquises
	of Lauriston.</p>

	<p>In the next chapter will be found an account of the madness which infected
	the people of England at the same time, and under very similar
	circumstances, but which, thanks to the energies and good sense of a
	constitutional government, was attended with results far less disastrous
	than those which were seen in France.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> South-Sea Company was originated by the celebrated Harley Earl of
	Oxford, in the year 1711, with the view of restoring public credit, which
	had suffered by the dismissal of the Whig ministry, and of providing for
	the discharge of the army and navy debentures, and other parts of the
	floating debt, amounting to nearly ten millions sterling. A company of
	merchants, at that time without a name, took this debt upon themselves,
	and the government agreed to secure them for a certain period the interest
	of six per cent. To provide for this interest, amounting to 600,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per
	annum, the duties upon wines, vinegar, India goods, wrought silks,
	tobacco, whale-fins, and some other articles, were rendered permanent. The
	monopoly of the trade to the South Seas was granted, and the company,
	being incorporated by act of parliament, assumed the title by which it has
	ever since been known. The minister took great credit to himself for his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>share in this transaction, and the scheme was always called by his
	flatterers “the Earl of Oxford’s masterpiece.”</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>Even at this early period of its history the most visionary ideas were
	formed by the company and the public of the immense riches of the eastern
	coast of South America. Every body had heard of the gold and silver mines
	of Peru and Mexico; every one believed them to be inexhaustible, and that
	it was only necessary to send the manufactures of England to the coast to
	be repaid a hundred fold in gold and silver ingots by the natives. A
	report, industriously spread, that Spain was willing to concede four ports
	on the coasts of Chili and Peru for the purposes of traffic, increased the
	general confidence, and for many years the South-Sea Company’s stock was
	in high favour.</p>

	<p>Philip V. of Spain, however, never had any intention of admitting the
	English to a free trade in the ports of Spanish America. Negotiations were
	set on foot, but their only result was the <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">assiento</em> contract, or the
	privilege of supplying the colonies with negroes for thirty years, and of
	sending once a year a vessel, limited both as to tonnage and value of
	cargo, to trade with Mexico, Peru, or Chili. The latter permission was
	only granted upon the hard condition, that the King of Spain should enjoy
	one-fourth of the profits, and a tax of five per cent on the remainder.
	This was a great disappointment to the Earl of Oxford and his party, who
	were reminded much oftener than they found agreeable of the</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parturiunt montes, nascitur ridiculus mus.</em>”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">But the public confidence in the South-Sea Company was not shaken. The
	Earl of Oxford declared that Spain would permit two ships, in addition to
	the annual ship, to carry out merchandise during the first year; and a
	list was published, in which all the ports and harbours of these coasts
	were pompously set forth as open to the trade of Great Britain. The first
	voyage of the annual ship was not made till the year 1717, and in the
	following year the trade was suppressed by the rupture with Spain.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>The king’s speech, at the opening of the session of 1717, made pointed
	allusion to the state of public credit, and recommended that proper
	measures should be taken to reduce the national debt. The two great
	monetary corporations, the South-Sea Company and the Bank of England, made
	proposals to parliament on the 20th of May ensuing. The South-Sea Company
	prayed that their capital stock of ten millions might be increased to
	twelve, by subscription or otherwise, and offered to accept five per cent
	instead of six upon the whole amount. The bank made proposals equally
	advantageous. The house debated for some time, and finally three acts were
	passed, called the South-Sea Act, the Bank Act, and the General Fund Act.
	By the first, the proposals of the South-Sea Company were accepted, and
	that body held itself ready to advance the sum of two millions towards
	discharging the principal and interest of the debt due by the state for
	the four lottery funds, of the ninth and tenth years of Queen Anne. By the
	second act, the bank received a lower rate of interest for the sum of
	1,775,027<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> 15<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> due to it by the state, and agreed to deliver up to be
	cancelled as many exchequer bills as amounted to two millions sterling,
	and to accept of an annuity of one hundred thousand pounds, being after
	the rate of five per cent, the whole redeemable at one year’s notice. They
	were further required to be ready to advance, in case of need, a sum not
	exceeding 2,500,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> upon the same terms of five per cent interest,
	redeemable by parliament. The General Fund Act recited the various
	deficiencies, which were to be made good by the aids derived from the
	foregoing sources.</p>

	<p>The name of the South-Sea Company was thus continually before the public.
	Though their trade with the South American States produced little or no
	augmentation of their revenues, they continued to flourish as a monetary
	corporation. Their stock was in high request, and the directors, buoyed up
	with success, began to think of new means for extending their influence.
	The Mississippi scheme of John Law, which so dazzled and captivated the
	French people, inspired them with an idea that they could carry on the
	same game in England. The anticipated failure of his plans did not divert
	them from their intention. Wise in their own conceit, they imagined they
	could avoid his faults, carry on their schemes for ever, and stretch the
	cord of credit to its extremest tension, without causing it to snap
	asunder.</p>

	<p>It was while Law’s plan was at its greatest height of popularity, while
	people were crowding in thousands to the Rue Quincampoix, and ruining
	themselves with frantic eagerness, that the South-Sea directors laid
	before parliament their famous plan for paying off the national debt.
	Visions of boundless wealth floated before the fascinated eyes of the
	people in the two most celebrated countries of <a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>Europe. The English
	commenced their career of extravagance somewhat later than the French; but
	as soon as the delirium seized them, they were determined not to be
	outdone. Upon the 22d of January, 1720, the House of Commons resolved
	itself into a committee of the whole house, to take into consideration
	that part of the king’s speech at the opening of the session which related
	to the public debts, and the proposal of the South-Sea Company towards the
	redemption and sinking of the same. The proposal set forth at great
	length, and under several heads, the debts of the state, amounting to
	30,981,712<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>, which the company were anxious to take upon themselves, upon
	consideration of five per cent per annum, secured to them until Midsummer
	1727; after which time, the whole was to become redeemable at the pleasure
	of the legislature, and the interest to be reduced to four per cent. The
	proposal was received with great favour; but the Bank of England had many
	friends in the House of Commons, who were desirous that that body should
	share in the advantages that were likely to accrue. On behalf of this
	corporation it was represented, that they had performed great and eminent
	services to the state in the most difficult times, and deserved, at least,
	that if any advantage was to be made by public bargains of this nature,
	they should be preferred before a company that had never done any thing
	for the nation. The further consideration of the matter was accordingly
	postponed for five days. In the mean time, a plan was drawn up by the
	governors of the bank. The South-Sea Company, afraid that the bank might
	offer still more advantageous terms to the government than themselves,
	reconsidered their former proposal, and made some alterations in it, which
	they hoped would render it more acceptable. The principal change was a
	stipulation that the government might redeem these debts at the expiration
	of four years, instead of seven, as at first suggested. The bank resolved
	not to be outbidden in this singular auction, and the governors also
	reconsidered their first proposal, and sent in a new one.</p>

	<p>Thus, each corporation having made two proposals, the house began to
	deliberate. Mr. Robert Walpole was the chief speaker in favour of the
	bank, and Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the principal
	advocate on behalf of the South-Sea Company. It was resolved, on the 2d of
	February, that the proposals of the latter were most advantageous to the
	country. They were accordingly received, and leave was given to bring in a
	bill to that effect.</p>

	<p>Exchange Alley was in a fever of excitement. The company’s stock, which
	had been at a hundred and thirty the previous day, gradually rose to three
	hundred, and continued to rise with the most astonishing rapidity during
	the whole time that the bill in its several <a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>stages was under discussion.
	Mr. Walpole was almost the only statesman in the House who spoke out
	boldly against it. He warned them, in eloquent and solemn language, of the
	evils that would ensue. It countenanced, he said, “the dangerous practice
	of stock-jobbing, and would divert the genius of the nation from trade and
	industry. It would hold out a dangerous lure to decoy the unwary to their
	ruin, by making them part with the earnings of their labour for a prospect
	of imaginary wealth. The great principle of the project was an evil of
	first-rate magnitude; it was to raise artificially the value of the stock,
	by exciting and keeping up a general infatuation, and by promising
	dividends out of funds which could never be adequate to the purpose.” In a
	prophetic spirit he added, that if the plan succeeded, the directors would
	become masters of the government, form a new and absolute aristocracy in
	the kingdom, and control the resolutions of the legislature. If it failed,
	which he was convinced it would, the result would bring general discontent
	and ruin upon the country. Such would be the delusion, that when the evil
	day came, as come it would, the people would start up, as from a dream,
	and ask themselves if these things could have been true. All his eloquence
	was in vain. He was looked upon as a false prophet, or compared to the
	hoarse raven, croaking omens of evil. His friends, however, compared him
	to Cassandra, predicting evils which would only be believed when they came
	home to men’s hearths, and stared them in the face at their own boards.
	Although, in former times, the house had listened with the utmost
	attention to every word that fell from his lips, the benches became
	deserted when it was known that he would speak on the South-Sea question.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The bill was two months in its progress through the House of Commons.
	During this time every exertion was made by the directors and their
	friends, and more especially by the chairman, the noted Sir John Blunt, to
	raise the price of the stock. The most extravagant rumours were in
	circulation. Treaties between England and Spain were spoken of, whereby
	the latter was to grant a free trade to all her colonies; and the rich
	produce of the mines of Potosi-la-Paz was to be brought to England until
	silver should become almost as plentiful <a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>as iron. For cotton and woollen
	goods, with which we could supply them in abundance, the dwellers in
	Mexico were to empty their golden mines. The company of merchants trading
	to the South Seas would be the richest the world ever saw, and every
	hundred pounds invested in it would produce hundreds per annum to the
	stockholder. At last the stock was raised by these means to near four
	hundred; but, after fluctuating a good deal, settled at three hundred and
	thirty, at which price it remained when the bill passed the Commons by a
	majority of 172 against 55.</p>

	<p>In the House of Lords the bill was hurried through all its stages with
	unexampled rapidity. On the 4th of April it was read a first time; on the
	5th, it was read a second time; on the 6th, it was committed; and on the
	7th, was read a third time and passed.</p>

	<p>Several peers spoke warmly against the scheme; but their warnings fell
	upon dull, cold ears. A speculating frenzy had seized them as well as the
	plebeians. Lord North and Grey said the bill was unjust in its nature, and
	might prove fatal in its consequences, being calculated to enrich the few
	and impoverish the many. The Duke of Wharton followed; but, as he only
	retailed at second-hand the arguments so eloquently stated by Walpole in
	the Lower House, he was not listened to with even the same attention that
	had been bestowed upon Lord North and Grey. Earl Cowper followed on the
	same side, and compared the bill to the famous horse of the siege of Troy.
	Like that, it was ushered in and received with great pomp and acclamations
	of joy, but bore within it treachery and destruction. The Earl of
	Sunderland endeavoured to answer all objections; and on the question being
	put, there appeared only seventeen peers against, and eighty-three in
	favour of the project. The very same day on which it passed the Lords, it
	received the royal assent, and became the law of the land.</p>

	<p>It seemed at that time as if the whole nation had turned stockjobbers.
	Exchange Alley was every day blocked up by crowds, and Cornhill was
	impassable for the number of carriages. Every body came to purchase stock.
	“Every fool aspired to be a knave.” In the words of a ballad published at
	the time, and sung about the streets,<a href="#fn16" id="fnm16" title="A South-Sea Ballad..." class="fnmarker">16</a></p>

	<div class="poem">

	</div>

	<p>The inordinate thirst of gain that had afflicted all ranks of society was
	not to be slaked even in the South Sea. Other schemes, of the most
	extravagant kind, were started. The share-lists were speedily filled up,
	and an enormous traffic carried on in shares, while, of course, every
	means were resorted to to raise them to an artificial value in the market.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:268px;">
		<a href="images/image21.png"><img src="images/th_image21.png" alt="A crowded street scene." id="image21" width="268" height="274" /></a>
		<p class="caption">CORNHILL, 1720.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Contrary to all expectation, South-Sea stock fell when the bill received
	the royal assent. On the 7th of April the shares were quoted at three
	hundred and ten, and on the following day at two hundred and ninety.
	Already the directors had tasted the profits of their scheme, and it was
	not likely that they should quietly allow the stock to find its natural
	level without an effort to raise it. Immediately their busy emissaries
	were set to work. Every person interested in the success of the project
	endeavoured to draw a knot of listeners around him, to whom he expatiated
	on the treasures of the South American seas. Exchange Alley was crowded
	with attentive groups. One rumour alone, asserted with the utmost
	confidence, had an immediate <a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>effect upon the stock. It was said that Earl
	Stanhope had received overtures in France from the Spanish government to
	exchange Gibraltar and Port Mahon for some places on the coast of Peru,
	for the security and enlargement of the trade in the South Seas. Instead
	of one annual ship trading to those ports, and allowing the king of Spain
	twenty-five per cent out of the profits, the company might build and
	charter as many ships as they pleased, and pay no per centage whatever to
	any foreign potentate.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Visions of ingots danced before their eyes,”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">and stock rose rapidly. On the 12th of April, five days after the bill had
	become law, the directors opened their books for a subscription of a
	million, at the rate of 300<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> for every 100<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> capital. Such was the
	concourse of persons of all ranks, that this first subscription was found
	to amount to above two millions of original stock. It was to be paid at
	five payments, of 60<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> each for every 100<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> In a few days the stock
	advanced to three hundred and forty, and the subscriptions were sold for
	double the price of the first payment. To raise the stock still higher, it
	was declared, in a general court of directors, on the 21st of April, that
	the midsummer dividend should be ten per cent, and that all subscriptions
	should be entitled to the same. These resolutions answering the end
	designed, the directors, to improve the infatuation of the monied men,
	opened their books for a second subscription of a million, at four hundred
	per cent. Such was the frantic eagerness of people of every class to
	speculate in these funds, that in the course of a few hours no less than a
	million and a half was subscribed at that rate.</p>

	<p>In the mean time, innumerable joint-stock companies started up every
	where. They soon received the name of Bubbles, the most appropriate that
	imagination could devise. The populace are often most happy in the
	nicknames they employ. None could be more apt than that of Bubbles. Some
	of them lasted for a week or a fortnight, and were no more heard of, while
	others could not even live out that short span of existence. Every evening
	produced new schemes, and every morning new projects. The highest of the
	aristocracy were as eager in this hot pursuit of gain as the most plodding
	jobber in Cornhill. The Prince of Wales became governor of one company,
	and is said to have cleared 40,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> by his speculations.<a href="#fn17" id="fnm17" title="Coxe's Walpole..." class="fnmarker">17</a> The Duke of
	Bridgewater started a scheme for the improvement of London and
	Westminster, and the Duke of Chandos another. There were nearly a hundred
	different projects, each more extravagant and deceptive than the other, To
	use the words of the <cite>Political State</cite>, they were <a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>“set on foot and
	promoted by crafty knaves, then pursued by multitudes of covetous fools,
	and at last appeared to be, in effect, what their vulgar appellation
	denoted them to be—bubbles and mere cheats.” It was computed that near
	one million and a half sterling was won and lost by these unwarrantable
	practices, to the impoverishment of many a fool, and the enriching of many
	a rogue.</p>

	<p>Some of these schemes were plausible enough, and, had they been undertaken
	at a time when the public mind was unexcited, might have been pursued with
	advantage to all concerned. But they were established merely with the view
	of raising the shares in the market. The projectors took the first
	opportunity of a rise to sell out, and next morning the scheme was at an
	end. Maitland, in his <cite>History of London</cite>, gravely informs us, that one of
	the projects which received great encouragement, was for the establishment
	of a company “to make deal boards out of saw-dust.” This is no doubt
	intended as a joke; but there is abundance of evidence to shew that dozens
	of schemes, hardly a whit more reasonable, lived their little day, ruining
	hundreds ere they fell. One of them was for a wheel for perpetual
	motion—capital one million; another was “for encouraging the breed of
	horses in England, and improving of glebe and church lands, and repairing
	and rebuilding parsonage and vicarage houses.” Why the clergy, who were so
	mainly interested in the latter clause, should have taken so much interest
	in the first, is only to be explained on the supposition that the scheme
	was projected by a knot of the fox-hunting parsons, once so common in
	England. The shares of this company were rapidly subscribed for. But the
	most absurd and preposterous of all, and which shewed, more completely
	than any other, the utter madness of the people, was one started by an
	unknown adventurer, entitled “<cite>A company for carrying on an undertaking of
	great advantage, but nobody to know what it is</cite>.” Were not the fact stated
	by scores of credible witnesses, it would be impossible to believe that
	any person could have been duped by such a project. The man of genius who
	essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity, merely
	stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a million, in
	five thousand shares of 100<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> each, deposit 2<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per share. Each
	subscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled to 100<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per annum per
	share. How this immense profit was to be obtained, he did not condescend
	to inform them at that time, but promised that in a month full particulars
	should be duly announced, and a call made for the remaining 98<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> of the
	subscription. Next morning, at nine o’clock, this great man opened an
	office in Cornhill. Crowds of people beset his door, and when he shut up
	at three o’clock, he found that no less than one thousand shares had been
	subscribed for, <a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>and the deposits paid. He was thus, in five hours, the
	winner of 2000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> He was philosopher enough to be contented with his
	venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never
	heard of again.</p>

	<p>Well might Swift exclaim, comparing Change Alley to a gulf in the South
	Sea:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>“Subscribers here by thousands float,</p>
			<p class="i2">And jostle one another down,</p>

		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>Now buried in the depths below,</p>
			<p class="i2">Now mounted up to heaven again,</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Another fraud that was very successful was that of the “Globe <em>Permits</em>,”
	as they were called. They were nothing more than square pieces of
	playing-cards, on which was the impression of a seal, in wax, bearing the
	sign of the Globe Tavern, in the neighbourhood of Exchange Alley, with the
	inscription of “Sail-Cloth Permits.” The possessors enjoyed no other
	advantage from them than permission to subscribe at some future time to a
	new sail-cloth manufactory, projected by one who was then known to be a
	man of fortune, but who was afterwards involved in the peculation and
	punishment of the South-Sea directors. These permits sold for as much as
	sixty guineas in the Alley.</p>

	<p>Persons of distinction, of both sexes, were deeply engaged in all these
	bubbles; those of the male sex going to taverns and coffee-houses to meet
	their brokers, and the ladies resorting for the same purpose to the shops
	of milliners and haberdashers. But it did not follow that all these people
	believed in the feasibility of the schemes to which they subscribed; it
	was enough for their purpose that their shares would, by stock-jobbing
	arts, be soon raised to a premium, when they got rid of them with all
	expedition to the really credulous. So great was the confusion of the
	crowd in the alley, that shares in the same bubble were known to have been
	sold at the same instant ten per cent higher at one end of the alley than
	at the other. Sensible men beheld the extraordinary infatuation of the
	people with sorrow and alarm. There were some both in and out of
	parliament who foresaw <a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>clearly the ruin that was impending. Mr. Walpole
	did not cease his gloomy forebodings. His fears were shared by all the
	thinking few, and impressed most forcibly upon the government. On the 11th
	of June, the day the parliament rose, the king published a proclamation,
	declaring that all these unlawful projects should be deemed public
	nuisances, and prosecuted accordingly, and forbidding any broker, under a
	penalty of five hundred pounds, from buying or selling any shares in them.
	Notwithstanding this proclamation, roguish speculators still carried them
	on, and the deluded people still encouraged them. On the 12th of July, an
	order of the Lords Justices assembled in privy council was published,
	dismissing all the petitions that had been presented for patents and
	charters, and dissolving all the bubble companies. The following copy of
	their lordships’ order, containing a list of all these nefarious projects,
	will not be deemed uninteresting at the present time, when, at periodic
	intervals, there is but too much tendency in the public mind to indulge in
	similar practices:</p>

	<p>Besides these bubbles, many others sprang up daily, in-spite of the
	condemnation of the government and the ridicule of the still sane portion
	of the public. The print-shops teemed with caricatures, and the newspapers
	with epigrams and satires, upon the prevalent <a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>folly. An ingenious
	cardmaker published a pack of South-Sea playing-cards, which are now
	extremely rare, each card containing, besides the usual figures, of a very
	small size, in one corner, a caricature of a bubble-company, with
	appropriate verses underneath. One of the most famous bubbles was
	“Puckle’s Machine Company,” for discharging round and square cannon-balls
	and bullets, and making a total revolution in the art of war. Its
	pretensions to public favour were thus summed up on the eight of spades:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“A rare invention to destroy the crowd</p>
		<p>Of fools at home instead of fools abroad.</p>
		<p>Fear not, my friends, this terrible machine,</p>
		<p>They’re only wounded who have shares therein.”</p>
	</div>

		<p class="caption">TREE CARICATURE<a href="#fn19" id="fnm19" title="Tree, surrounded by water..." class="fnmarker">19</a></p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>The nine of hearts was a caricature of the English Copper and Brass
	Company, with the following epigram:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“The headlong-fool that wants to be a swopper</p>
		<p>Of gold and silver coin for English copper,</p>
		<p>May, in Change Alley, prove himself an ass,</p>
		<p>And give rich metal for adultrate brass.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>The eight of diamonds celebrated the company for the colonisation of
	Acadia, with this doggrel:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“He that is rich and wants to fool away</p>
		<p>A good round sum in North America,</p>
		<p>Let him subscribe himself a headlong sharer,</p>
		<p>And asses’ ears shall honour him or bearer.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>And in a similar style every card of the pack exposed some knavish scheme,
	and ridiculed the persons who were its dupes. It was computed that the
	total amount of the sums proposed for carrying on these projects was
	upwards of three hundred millions sterling.</p>

	<p>It is time, however, to return to the great South-Sea gulf, that swallowed
	the fortunes of so many thousands of the avaricious and the credulous. On
	the 29th of May, the stock had risen as high as five hundred, and about
	two-thirds of the government annuitants had exchanged the securities of
	the state for those of the South-Sea company. During the whole of the
	month of May the stock continued to rise, and on the 28th it was quoted at
	five hundred and fifty. In four days after this it took a prodigious leap,
	rising suddenly from five hundred and fifty to eight hundred and ninety.
	It was now the general opinion that the stock could rise no higher, and
	many persons took that opportunity of selling out, with a view of
	realising their profits. Many <a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"></a>noblemen and persons in the train of the
	king, and about to accompany him to Hanover, were also anxious to sell
	out. So many sellers, and so few buyers, appeared in the Alley on the 3d
	of June, that the stock fell at once from eight hundred and ninety to six
	hundred and forty. The directors were alarmed, and gave their agents
	orders to buy. Their efforts succeeded. Towards evening, confidence was
	restored, and the stock advanced to seven hundred and fifty. It continued
	at this price, with some slight fluctuation, until the company closed
	their books on the 22d of June.</p>

	<p>It would be needless and uninteresting to detail the various arts employed
	by the directors to keep up the price of stock. It will be sufficient to
	state that it finally rose to one thousand per cent. It was quoted at this
	price in, the commencement of August. The bubble was then full-blown, and
	began to quiver and shake preparatory to its bursting.</p>

	<p>Many of the government annuitants expressed dissatisfaction against the
	directors. They accused them of partiality in making out the lists for
	shares in each subscription. Further uneasiness was occasioned by its
	being generally known that Sir John Blunt the chairman, and some others,
	had sold out. During the whole of the month of August the stock fell, and
	on the 2d of September it was quoted at seven hundred only.</p>

	<p>The state of things now became alarming. To prevent, if possible, the
	utter extinction of public confidence in their proceedings, the directors
	summoned a general court of the whole corporation, to meet in Merchant
	Tailors’ Hall on the 8th of September. By nine o’clock in the morning, the
	room was filled to suffocation; Cheapside was blocked up by a crowd unable
	to gain admittance, and the greatest excitement prevailed. The directors
	and their friends mustered in great numbers. Sir John Fellowes, the
	sub-governor, was called to the chair. He acquainted the assembly with the
	cause of their meeting; read to them the several resolutions of the court
	of directors, and gave them an account of their proceedings; of the taking
	in the redeemable and unredeemable funds, and of the subscriptions in
	money. Mr. Secretary Craggs then made a short speech, wherein he commended
	the conduct of the directors, and urged that nothing could more
	effectually contribute to the bringing this scheme to perfection than
	union among themselves. He concluded with a motion for thanking the court
	of directors for their prudent and skilful management, and for desiring
	them to proceed in such manner as they should think most proper for the
	interest and advantage of the corporation. Mr. Hungerford, who had
	rendered himself very conspicuous in the House of Commons for his zeal in
	behalf of the South-Sea <a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"></a>company, and who was shrewdly suspected to have
	been a considerable gainer by knowing the right time to sell out, was very
	magniloquent on this occasion. He said that he had seen the rise and fall,
	the decay and resurrection of many communities of this nature, but that,
	in his opinion, none had ever performed such wonderful things in so short
	a time as the South-Sea company. They had done more than the crown, the
	pulpit, or the bench could do. They had reconciled all parties in one
	common interest; they had laid asleep, if not wholly extinguished, all the
	domestic jars and animosities of the nation. By the rise of their stock,
	monied men had vastly increased their fortunes; country gentlemen had seen
	the value of their lands doubled and trebled in their hands. They had at
	the same time done good to the Church, not a few of the reverend clergy
	having got great sums by the project. In short, they had enriched the
	whole nation, and he hoped they had not forgotten themselves. There was
	some hissing at the latter part of this speech, which for the extravagance
	of its eulogy was not far removed from satire; but the directors and their
	friends, and all the winners in the room, applauded vehemently. The Duke
	of Portland spoke in a similar strain, and expressed his great wonder why
	any body should be dissatisfied; of course, he was a winner by his
	speculations, and in a condition similar to that of the fat alderman in
	<cite>Joe Miller’s Jests</cite>, who, whenever he had eaten a good dinner, folded his
	hands upon his paunch, and expressed his doubts whether there could be a
	hungry man in the world.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Several resolutions were passed at this meeting, but they had no effect
	upon the public. Upon the very same evening the stock fell to six hundred
	and forty, and on the morrow to five hundred and forty. Day after day it
	continued to fall, until it was as low as four hundred. In a letter dated
	September 13th, from Mr. Broderick, M.P., to Lord Chancellor Middleton,
	and published in Coxe’s <cite>Walpole</cite>, the former says: “Various are the
	conjectures why the South-Sea directors have suffered the cloud to break
	so early. I made no doubt but they would do so when they found it to their
	advantage. They have stretched credit so far beyond what it would bear,
	that specie proves insufficient to support it. Their most considerable men
	have drawn out, securing themselves by the losses of the deluded,
	thoughtless <a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"></a>numbers, whose understandings have been overruled by avarice
	and the hope of making mountains out of mole-hills. Thousands of families
	will be reduced to beggary. The consternation is inexpressible—the rage
	beyond description, and the case altogether so desperate, that I do not
	see any plan or scheme so much as thought of for averting the blow, so
	that I cannot pretend to guess what is next to be done.” Ten days
	afterwards, the stock still falling, he writes: “The company have yet come
	to no determination, for they are in such a wood that they know not which
	way to turn. By several gentlemen lately come to town, I perceive the very
	name of a South-Sea-man grows abominable in every country. A great many
	goldsmiths are already run off, and more will daily. I question whether
	one-third, nay, one-fourth of them can stand it. From the very beginning,
	I founded my judgment of the whole affair upon the unquestionable maxim,
	that ten millions (which is more than our running cash) could not
	circulate two hundred millions, beyond which our paper credit extended.
	That, therefore, whenever that should become doubtful, be the cause what
	it would, our noble state machine must inevitably fall to the ground.”</p>

	<p>On the 12th of September, at the earnest solicitation of Mr. Secretary
	Craggs, several conferences were held between the directors of the South
	Sea and the directors of the Bank. A report which was circulated, that the
	latter had agreed to circulate six millions of the South-Sea company’s
	bonds, caused the stock to rise to six hundred and seventy; but in the
	afternoon, as soon as the report was known to be groundless, the stock
	fell again to five hundred and eighty; the next day to five hundred and
	seventy, and so gradually to four hundred.<a href="#fn20" id="fnm20" title="Gay (the poet)..." class="fnmarker">20</a></p>

	<p>The ministry were seriously alarmed at the aspect of affairs. The
	directors could not appear in the streets without being insulted;
	dangerous riots were every moment apprehended. Despatches were sent off to
	the king at Hanover, praying his immediate return. Mr. Walpole, who was
	staying at his country seat, was sent for, that he might employ his known
	influence with the directors of the Bank of England to induce them to
	accept the proposal made by the South-Sea company for circulating a number
	of their bonds.</p>

	<p>The Bank was very unwilling to mix itself up with the affairs of the
	company; it dreaded being involved in calamities which it could <a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"></a>not
	relieve, and received all overtures with visible reluctance. But the
	universal voice of the nation called upon it to come to the rescue. Every
	person of note in commercial politics was called in to advise in the
	emergency. A rough draft of a contract drawn up by Mr. Walpole was
	ultimately adopted as the basis of further negotiations, and the public
	alarm abated a little.</p>

	<p>On the following day, the 20th of September, a general court of the
	South-Sea company was held at Merchant Tailors’ Hall, in which resolutions
	were carried, empowering the directors to agree with the Bank of England,
	or any other persons, to circulate the company’s bonds, or make any other
	agreement with the Bank which they should think proper. One of the
	speakers, a Mr. Pulteney, said it was most surprising to see the
	extraordinary panic which had seized upon the people. Men were running to
	and fro in alarm and terror, their imaginations filled with some great
	calamity, the form and dimensions of which nobody knew:</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Black it stood as night—</p>
		<p>Fierce as ten furies—terrible as hell.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>At a general court of the Bank of England held two days afterwards, the
	governor informed them of the several meetings that had been held on the
	affairs of the South-Sea company, adding that the directors had not yet
	thought fit to come to any decision upon the matter. A resolution was then
	proposed, and carried without a dissentient voice, empowering the
	directors to agree with those of the South Sea to circulate their bonds,
	to what sum, and upon what terms, and for what time, they might think
	proper.</p>

	<p>Thus both parties were at liberty to act as they might judge best for the
	public interest. Books were opened at the Bank for a subscription of three
	millions for the support of public credit, on the usual terms of 15<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per
	cent deposit, 3<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per cent premium, and 5<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> per cent interest. So great
	was the concourse of people in the early part of the morning, all eagerly
	bringing their money, that it was thought the subscription would be filled
	that day; but before noon, the tide turned. In spite of all that could be
	done to prevent it, the South-Sea company’s stock fell rapidly. Their
	bonds were in such discredit, that a run commenced upon the most eminent
	goldsmiths and bankers, some of whom, having lent out great sums upon
	South-Sea stock, were obliged to shut up their shops and abscond. The
	Sword-blade company, who had hitherto been the chief cashiers of the
	South-Sea company, stopped payment. This being looked upon as but the
	beginning of evil, occasioned a great run upon the Bank, who were now
	obliged to pay out money much faster than they had received it upon the
	subscription in the morning. The day succeeding was a holiday (the 29th <a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"></a>of
	September), and the Bank had a little breathing time. They bore up against
	the storm; but their former rivals, the South-Sea company, were wrecked
	upon it. Their stock fell to one hundred and fifty, and gradually, after
	various fluctuations, to one hundred and thirty-five.</p>

	<p>The Bank, finding they were not able to restore public confidence, and
	stem the tide of ruin, without running the risk of being swept away with
	those they intended to save, declined to carry out the agreement into
	which they had partially entered. They were under no obligation whatever
	to continue; for the so-called Bank contract was nothing more than the
	rough draught of an agreement, in which blanks had been left for several
	important particulars, and which contained no penalty for their secession.
	“And thus,” to use the words of the Parliamentary History, “were seen, in
	the space of eight months, the rise, progress, and fall of that mighty
	fabric, which, being wound up by mysterious springs to a wonderful height,
	had fixed the eyes and expectations of all Europe, but whose foundation,
	being fraud, illusion, credulity, and infatuation, fell to the ground as
	soon as the artful management of its directors was discovered.”</p>

	<p>In the hey-day of its blood, during the progress of this dangerous
	delusion, the manners of the nation became sensibly corrupted. The
	parliamentary inquiry, set on foot to discover the delinquents, disclosed
	scenes of infamy, disgraceful alike to the morals of the offenders and the
	intellects of the people among whom they had arisen. It is a deeply
	interesting study to investigate all the evils that were the result.
	Nations, like individuals, cannot become desperate gamblers with impunity.
	Punishment is sure to overtake them sooner or later. A celebrated
	writer<a href="#fn21" id="fnm21" title="Smollett." class="fnmarker">21</a> is quite wrong when he says, “that such an era as this is the
	most unfavourable for a historian; that no reader of sentiment and
	imagination can be entertained or interested by a detail of transactions
	such as these, which admit of no warmth, no colouring, no embellishment; a
	detail of which only serves to exhibit an inanimate picture of tasteless
	vice and mean degeneracy.” On the contrary,—and Smollett might have
	discovered it, if he had been in the humour,—the subject is capable of
	inspiring as much interest as even a novellist can desire. Is there no
	warmth in the despair of a plundered people?—no life and animation in the
	picture which might be drawn of the woes of hundreds of impoverished and
	ruined families? of the wealthy of yesterday become the beggars of to-day?
	of the powerful and influential changed into exiles and outcasts, and the
	voice of self-reproach and imprecation resounding from every corner of the
	land? Is it a dull or uninstructive picture to see a whole people shaking
	suddenly off the trammels of reason, and running <a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"></a>wild after a golden
	vision, refusing obstinately to believe that it is not real, till, like a
	deluded hind running after an <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</em>, they are plunged into a
	quagmire? But in this false spirit has history too often been written. The
	intrigues of unworthy courtiers to gain the favour of still more unworthy
	kings, or the records of murderous battles and sieges, have been dilated
	on, and told over and over again, with all the eloquence of style and all
	the charms of fancy; while the circumstances which have most deeply
	affected the morals and welfare of the people have been passed over with
	but slight notice, as dry and dull, and capable of neither warmth nor
	colouring.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>During the progress of this famous bubble, England presented a singular
	spectacle. The public mind was in a state of unwholesome fermentation. Men
	were no longer satisfied with the slow but sure profits of cautious
	industry. The hope of boundless wealth for the <a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"></a>morrow made them heedless
	and extravagant for to-day. A luxury, till then unheard-of, was
	introduced, bringing in its train a corresponding laxity of morals. The
	over-bearing insolence of ignorant men, who had arisen to sudden wealth by
	successful gambling, made men of true gentility of mind and manners blush
	that gold should have power to raise the unworthy in the scale of society.
	The haughtiness of some of these “cyphering cits,” as they were termed by
	Sir Richard Steele, was remembered against them in the day of their
	adversity. In the parliamentary inquiry, many of the directors suffered
	more for their insolence than for their peculation. One of them, who, in
	the full-blown pride of an ignorant rich man, had said that he would feed
	his horse upon gold, was reduced almost to bread and water for himself;
	every haughty look, every overbearing speech, was set down, and repaid
	them a hundredfold in poverty and humiliation.</p>

	<p>The state of matters all over the country was so alarming, that George I.
	shortened his intended stay in Hanover, and returned in all haste to
	England. He arrived on the 11th of November, and parliament was summoned
	to meet on the 8th of December. In the mean time, public meetings were
	held in every considerable town of the empire, at which petitions were
	adopted, praying the vengeance of the legislature upon the South-Sea
	directors, who, by their fraudulent practices, had brought the nation to
	the brink of ruin. Nobody seemed to imagine that the nation itself was as
	culpable as the South-Sea company. Nobody blamed the credulity and avarice
	of the people,—the degrading lust of gain, which had swallowed up every
	nobler quality in the national character, or the infatuation which had
	made the multitude run their heads with such frantic eagerness into the
	net held out for them by scheming projectors. These things were never
	mentioned. The people were a simple, honest, hard-working people, ruined
	by a gang of robbers, who were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered without
	mercy.</p>

	<p>This was the almost unanimous feeling of the country. The two Houses of
	Parliament were not more reasonable. Before the guilt of the South-Sea
	directors was known, punishment was the only cry. The king, in his speech
	from the throne, expressed his hope that they would remember that all
	their prudence, temper, and resolution were necessary to find out and
	apply the proper remedy for their misfortunes. In the debate on the answer
	to the address, several speakers indulged in the most violent invectives
	against the directors of the South-Sea project. The Lord Molesworth was
	particularly vehement. “It had been said by some, that there was no law to
	punish the directors of the South-Sea company, who were justly looked upon
	as the authors of the present misfortunes of the state. In his opinion,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"></a>they ought upon this occasion to follow the example of the ancient Romans,
	who, having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed
	no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his
	father’s blood, made a law to punish this heinous crime as soon as it was
	committed. They adjudged the guilty wretch to be sown in a sack, and
	thrown alive into the Tiber. He looked upon the contrivers and executors
	of the villanous South-Sea scheme as the parricides of their country, and
	should be satisfied to see them tied in like manner in sacks, and thrown
	into the Thames.” Other members spoke with as much want of temper and
	discretion. Mr. Walpole was more moderate. He recommended that their first
	care should be to restore public credit. “If the city of London were on
	fire, all wise men would aid in extinguishing the flames, and preventing
	the spread of the conflagration, before they inquired after the incendiaries.
	Public credit had received a dangerous wound, and lay bleeding, and they
	ought to apply a speedy remedy to it. It was time enough to punish the
	assassin afterwards.” On the 9th of December an address, in answer to his
	majesty’s speech, was agreed upon, after an amendment, which was carried
	without a division, that words should be added expressive of the
	determination of the house not only to seek a remedy for the national
	distresses, but to punish the authors of them.</p>
	
	<div class="figleft" style="width:196px;">

		<p class="caption">BRITANNIA STRIPT BY A SOUTH-SEA DIRECTOR.<a href="#fn23" id="fnm23" title="Britannia stript..." class="fnmarker">23</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>The inquiry proceeded rapidly. The directors were ordered to lay before
	the house a full account of all their proceedings. Resolutions were passed
	to the effect that the calamity was mainly owing to the vile arts of
	stock-jobbers, and that nothing could tend more to the reestablishment of
	public credit than a law to prevent this infamous <a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"></a>practice. Mr. Walpole
	then rose, and said, that “as he had previously hinted, he had spent some
	time upon a scheme for restoring public credit, but that the execution of
	it depending upon a position which had been laid down as fundamental, he
	thought it proper, before he opened out his scheme, to be informed whether
	he might rely upon that foundation. It was, whether the subscription of
	public debts and encumbrances, money subscriptions, and other contracts,
	made with the South-Sea company, should remain in the present state?” This
	question occasioned an animated debate. It was finally agreed, by a
	majority of 259 against 117, that all these contracts should remain in
	their present state, unless altered for the relief of the proprietors by a
	general court of the South-Sea company, or set aside by due course of law.
	On the following day, Mr. Walpole laid before a committee of the whole
	house his scheme for the restoration of public credit, which was, in
	substance, to engraft nine millions of South-Sea stock into the Bank of
	England, and the same sum into the East India company, upon certain
	conditions. The plan was favourably received by the house. After some few
	objections, it was ordered that proposals should be received from the two
	great corporations. They were both unwilling to lend their aid, and the
	plan met with a warm but fruitless opposition at the general courts
	summoned for the purpose of deliberating upon it. They, however,
	ultimately agreed upon the terms on which they would consent to circulate
	the South-Sea bonds, and their report being presented to the committee, a
	bill was brought in under the superintendence of Mr. Walpole, and safely
	carried through both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p>A bill was at the same time brought in for restraining the South-Sea
	directors, governor, sub-governor, treasurer, cashier, and clerks from
	leaving the kingdom for a twelvemonth, and for discovering their estates
	and effects, and preventing them from transporting or alienating the same.
	All the most influential members of the House supported the bill. Mr.
	Shippen, seeing Mr. Secretary Craggs in his place, and believing the
	injurious rumours that were afloat of that minister’s conduct in the
	South-Sea business, determined to touch him to the quick. He said, he was
	glad to see a British House of Commons resuming its pristine vigour and
	spirit, and acting with so much unanimity for the public good. It was
	necessary to secure the persons and estates of the South-Sea directors and
	their officers; “but,” he added, looking fixedly at Mr. Craggs as he
	spoke, “there were other men in high station, whom, in time, he would not
	be afraid to name, who were no less guilty than the directors.” Mr. Craggs
	arose in great wrath, and said, that if the innuendo were directed against
	him, he was ready to give satisfaction to any man <a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"></a>who questioned him,
	either in the House or out of it. Loud cries of order immediately arose on
	every side. In the midst of the uproar, Lord Molesworth got up, and
	expressed his wonder at the boldness of Mr. Craggs in challenging the
	whole House of Commons. He, Lord Molesworth, though somewhat old, past
	sixty, would answer Mr. Craggs whatever he had to say in the House, and he
	trusted there were plenty of young men beside him, who would not be afraid
	to look Mr. Craggs in the face out of the House. The cries of order again
	resounded from every side; the members arose simultaneously; every body
	seemed to be vociferating at once. The speaker in vain called order. The
	confusion lasted several minutes, during which Lord Molesworth and Mr.
	Craggs were almost the only members who kept their seats. At last, the
	call for Mr. Craggs became so violent, that he thought proper to submit to
	the universal feeling of the House, and explain his unparliamentary
	expression. He said, that by giving satisfaction to the impugners of his
	conduct in that House, he did not mean that he would fight, but that he
	would explain his conduct. Here the matter ended, and the House proceeded
	to debate in what manner they should conduct their inquiry into the
	affairs of the South-Sea company, whether in a grand or a select
	committee. Ultimately, a secret committee of thirteen was appointed, with
	power to send for persons, papers, and records.</p>

	<p>The Lords were as zealous and as hasty as the Commons. The Bishop of
	Rochester said the scheme had been like a pestilence. The Duke of Wharton
	said the House ought to shew no respect of persons; that, for his part, he
	would give up the dearest friend he had, if he had been engaged in the
	project. The nation had been plundered in a most shameful and flagrant
	manner, and he would go as far as any body in the punishment of the
	offenders. Lord Stanhope said, that every farthing possessed by the
	criminals, whether directors or not directors, ought to be confiscated, to
	make good the public losses.</p>

	<p>During all this time the public excitement was extreme. We learn from
	Coxe’s <cite>Walpole</cite>, that the very name of a South-Sea director was thought
	to be synonymous with every species of fraud and villany. Petitions from
	counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were
	presented, crying for the justice due to an injured nation and the
	punishment of the villanous peculators. Those moderate men, who would not
	go to extreme lengths, even in the punishment of the guilty, were accused
	of being accomplices, were exposed to repeated insults and virulent
	invectives, and devoted, both in anonymous letters and public writings, to
	the speedy vengeance of an injured people. The accusations against Mr.
	Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Craggs, another member of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"></a>the ministry, were so loud, that the House of Lords resolved to proceed at
	once into the investigation concerning them. It was ordered, on the 21st
	of January, that all brokers concerned in the South-Sea scheme should lay
	before the House an account of the stock or subscriptions bought or sold
	by them for any of the officers of the Treasury or Exchequer, or in trust
	for any of them, since Michaelmas 1719. When this account was delivered,
	it appeared that large quantities of stock had been transferred to the use
	of Mr. Aislabie. Five of the South-Sea directors, including Mr. Edward
	Gibbon, the grandfather of the celebrated historian, were ordered into the
	custody of the black rod. Upon a motion made by Earl Stanhope, it was
	unanimously resolved, that the taking in or giving credit for stock
	without a valuable consideration actually paid or sufficiently secured; or
	the purchasing stock by any director or agent of the South-Sea company,
	for the use or benefit of any member of the administration, or any member
	of either House of Parliament, during such time as the South-Sea bill was
	yet pending in parliament, was a notorious and dangerous corruption.
	Another resolution was passed a few days afterwards, to the effect that
	several of the directors and officers of the company having, in a
	clandestine manner, sold their own stock to the company, had been guilty
	of a notorious fraud and breach of trust, and had thereby mainly caused
	the unhappy turn of affairs that had so much affected public credit. Mr.
	Aislabie resigned his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and absented
	himself from parliament, until the formal inquiry into his individual
	guilt was brought under the consideration of the legislature.</p>

	<p>In the mean time, Knight, the treasurer of the company, and who was
	entrusted with all the dangerous secrets of the dishonest directors,
	packed up his books and documents, and made his escape from the country.
	He embarked in disguise, in a small boat on the river, and proceeding to a
	vessel hired for the purpose, was safely conveyed to Calais. The Committee
	of Secrecy informed the House of the circumstance, when it was resolved
	unanimously that two addresses should be presented to the king; the first
	praying that he would issue a proclamation offering a reward for the
	apprehension of Knight; and the second, that he would give immediate
	orders to stop the ports, and to take effectual care of the coasts, to
	prevent the said Knight, or any other officers of the South-Sea company,
	from escaping out of the kingdom. The ink was hardly dry upon these
	addresses before they were carried to the king by Mr. Methuen, deputed by
	the House for that purpose. The same evening a royal proclamation was
	issued, offering a reward of two thousand pounds for the apprehension of
	Knight. The Commons ordered the doors of <a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"></a>the House to be locked, and the
	keys to be placed on the table. General Ross, one of the members of the
	Committee of Secrecy, acquainted them that they had already discovered a
	train of the deepest villany and fraud that hell had ever contrived to
	ruin a nation, which in due time they would lay before the House. In the
	mean time, in order to a further discovery, the Committee thought it
	highly necessary to secure the persons of some of the directors and
	principal South-Sea officers, and to seize their papers. A motion to this
	effect having been made, was carried unanimously. Sir Robert Chaplin, Sir
	Theodore Janssen, Mr. Sawbridge, and Mr. F. Eyles, members of the House,
	and directors of the South-Sea company, were summoned to appear in their
	places, and answer for their corrupt practices. Sir Theodore Janssen and
	Mr. Sawbridge answered to their names, and endeavoured to exculpate
	themselves. The House heard them patiently, and then ordered them to
	withdraw. A motion was then made, and carried <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine contradicente</em>, that
	they had been guilty of a notorious breach of trust—had occasioned much
	loss to great numbers of his majesty’s subjects, and had highly prejudiced
	the public credit. It was then ordered that, for their offence, they
	should be expelled the House, and taken into the custody of the
	sergeant-at-arms. Sir Robert Chaplin and Mr. Eyles, attending in their
	places four days afterwards, were also expelled the House. It was resolved
	at the same time to address the king to give directions to his ministers
	at foreign courts to make application for Knight, that he might be
	delivered up to the English authorities, in case he took refuge in any of
	their dominions. The king at once agreed, and messengers were despatched
	to all parts of the continent the same night.</p>

	<p>Among the directors taken into custody was Sir John Blunt, the man whom
	popular opinion has generally accused of having been the original author
	and father of the scheme. This man, we are informed by Pope, in his
	epistle to Allen Lord Bathurst, was a dissenter, of a most religious
	deportment, and professed to be a great believer.<a href="#fn24" id="fnm24" title="'God cannot love'..." class="fnmarker">24</a> He constantly
	declaimed against the luxury and corruption <a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"></a>of the age, the partiality of
	parliaments, and the misery of party spirit. He was particularly eloquent
	against avarice in great and noble persons. He was originally a scrivener,
	and afterwards became, not only a director, but the most active manager of
	the South-Sea company. Whether it was during his career in this capacity
	that he first began to declaim against the avarice of the great, we are
	not informed. He certainly must have seen enough of it to justify his
	severest anathema; but if the preacher had himself been free from the vice
	he condemned, his declamations would have had a better effect. He was
	brought up in custody to the bar of the House of Lords, and underwent a
	long examination. He refused to answer several important questions. He
	said he had been examined already by a committee of the House of Commons,
	and as he did not remember his answers, and might contradict himself, he
	refused to answer before another tribunal. This declaration, in itself an
	indirect proof of guilt, occasioned some commotion in the House. He was
	again asked peremptorily whether he had ever sold any portion of the stock
	to any member of the administration, or any member of either House of
	Parliament, to facilitate the passing of the bill. He again declined to
	answer. He was anxious, he said, to treat the House with all possible
	respect, but he thought it hard to be compelled to accuse himself. After
	several ineffectual attempts to refresh his memory, he was directed to
	withdraw. A violent discussion ensued between the friends and opponents of
	the ministry. It was asserted that the administration were no strangers to
	the convenient taciturnity of Sir John Blunt. The Duke of Wharton made a
	reflection upon the Earl Stanhope, which the latter warmly resented. He
	spoke under great excitement, and with such vehemence as to cause a sudden
	determination of blood to the head. He felt himself so ill that he was
	obliged to leave the House and retire to his chamber. He was cupped
	immediately, and also let blood on the following morning, but with slight
	relief. The fatal result was not anticipated. Towards evening he became
	drowsy, and turning himself on his face, expired. The sudden death of this
	statesman caused great grief to the nation. George I. was exceedingly
	affected, and shut himself up for some hours in his closet, inconsolable
	for his loss.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"></a>Knight, the treasurer of the company, was apprehended at Tirlemont, near
	Liege, by one of the secretaries of Mr. Leathes, the British resident at
	Brussels, and lodged in the citadel of Antwerp. Repeated applications were
	made to the court of Austria to deliver him up, but in vain. Knight threw
	himself upon the protection of the states of Brabant, and demanded to be
	tried in that country. It was a privilege granted to the states of Brabant
	by one of the articles of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Joyeuse Entrée</cite>, that every criminal
	apprehended in that country should be tried in that country. The states
	insisted on their privilege, and refused to deliver Knight to the British
	authorities. The latter did not cease their solicitations; but in the mean
	time, Knight escaped from the citadel.</p>

	</div>

	<p>On the 16th of February the Committee of Secrecy made their first report
	to the House. They stated that their inquiry had been attended with
	numerous difficulties and embarrassments; every one they had examined had
	endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to defeat the ends of justice. In some
	of the books produced before them, false and fictitious entries had been
	made; in others, there were entries of money with blanks for the name of
	the stockholders. There were frequent erasures and alterations, and in
	some of the books leaves were torn out. They also found that some books of
	great importance had been destroyed altogether, and that some had <a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"></a>been
	taken away or secreted. At the very entrance into their inquiry, they had
	observed that the matters referred to them were of great variety and
	extent. Many persons had been entrusted with various parts in the
	execution of the law, and under colour thereof had acted in an
	unwarrantable manner, in disposing of the properties of many thousands of
	persons amounting to many millions of money. They discovered that, before
	the South-Sea Act was passed, there was an entry in the company’s books of
	the sum of 1,259,325<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>, upon account of stock stated to have been sold to
	the amount of 574,500<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> This stock was all fictitious, and had been
	disposed of with a view to promote the passing of the bill. It was noted
	as sold on various days, and at various prices, from 150 to 325 per cent.
	Being surprised to see so large an account disposed of at a time when the
	company were not empowered to increase their capital, the Committee
	determined to investigate most carefully the whole transaction. The
	governor, sub-governor, and several directors were brought before them,
	and examined rigidly. They found that, at the time these entries were
	made, the company was not in possession of such a quantity of stock,
	having in their own right only a small quantity, not exceeding thirty
	thousand pounds at the utmost. Pursuing the inquiry, they found that this
	amount of stock was to be esteemed as taken in or holden by the company
	for the benefit of the pretended purchasers, although no mutual agreement
	was made for its delivery or acceptance at any certain time. No money was
	paid down, nor any deposit or security whatever given to the company by
	the supposed purchasers; so that if the stock had fallen, as might have
	been expected had the act not passed, they would have sustained no loss.
	If, on the contrary, the price of stock advanced (as it actually did by
	the success of the scheme), the difference by the advanced price was to be
	made good to them. Accordingly, after the passing of the act, the account
	of stock was made up and adjusted with Mr. Knight, and the pretended
	purchasers were paid the difference out of the company’s cash. This
	fictitious stock, which had been chiefly at the disposal of Sir John
	Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, and Mr. Knight, was distributed among several members
	of the government and their connexions, by way of bribe, to facilitate the
	passing of the bill. To the Earl of Sunderland was assigned 50,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> of
	this stock; to the Duchess of Kendal, 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; to the Countess of Platen,
	10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; to her two nieces, 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; to Mr. Secretary Craggs, 30,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>;
	to Mr. Charles Stanhope (one of the secretaries of the Treasury),
	10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; to the Sword-blade company, 50,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> It also appeared that Mr.
	Stanhope had received the enormous sum of 250,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> as the difference in
	the price of some stock, through the <a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"></a>hands of Turner, Caswall, and Co.,
	but that his name had been partly erased from their books, and altered to
	Stangape. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had made profits
	still more abominable. He had an account with the same firm, who were also
	South-Sea directors, to the amount of 794,451<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> He had, besides, advised
	the company to make their second subscription one million and a half,
	instead of a million, by their own authority, and without any warrant. The
	third subscription had been conducted in a manner as disgraceful. Mr.
	Aislabie’s name was down for 70,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; Mr. Craggs, senior, for 659,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>;
	the Earl of Sunderland’s for 160,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; and Mr. Stanhope for 47,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> This
	report was succeeded by six others, less important. At the end of the
	last, the committee declared, that the absence of Knight, who had been
	principally entrusted, prevented them from carrying on their inquiries.</p>

	<p>The first report was ordered to be printed, and taken into consideration
	on the next day but one succeeding. After a very angry and animated
	debate, a series of resolutions were agreed to, condemnatory of the
	conduct of the directors, of the members of the parliament and of the
	administration concerned with them; and declaring that they ought, each
	and all, to make satisfaction out of their own estates for the injury they
	had done the public. Their practices were declared to be corrupt,
	infamous, and dangerous; and a bill was ordered to be brought in for the
	relief of the unhappy sufferers.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:352px;">
		<a href="images/image29.png"><img src="images/th_image29.png" alt="A huge crowd surrounds a roaring fire." id="image29" width="352" height="288" /></a>
		<p class="caption">BONFIRES ON TOWER HILL</p>
	</div>

	<p>Mr. Charles Stanhope was the first person brought to account for his share
	in these transactions. He urged in his defence that, for some years past,
	he had lodged all the money he was possessed of in Mr. Knight’s hands, and
	whatever stock Mr. Knight had taken in for him, he had paid a valuable
	consideration for it. As for the stock that had been bought for him by
	Turner, Caswall, and Co., he knew nothing about it. Whatever had been done
	in that matter was done without his authority, and he could not be
	responsible for it. Turner and Co. took the latter charge upon themselves;
	but it was notorious to every unbiassed and unprejudiced person that Mr.
	Stanhope was a gainer of the 250,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> which lay in the hands of that firm
	to his credit. He was, however, acquitted by a majority of three only. The
	greatest exertions were made to screen him. Lord Stanhope, the son of the
	Earl of Chesterfield, went round to the wavering members, using all the
	eloquence he was possessed of to induce them either to vote for the
	acquittal, or to absent themselves from the House. Many weak-headed
	country gentlemen were led astray by his persuasions, and the result was
	as already stated. The acquittal caused the greatest discontent throughout
	the country. Mobs of a menacing character assembled in different parts of
	London; fears of riots were generally <a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"></a>entertained, especially as the
	examination of a still greater delinquent was expected by many to have a
	similar termination. Mr. Aislabie, whose high office and deep
	responsibilities should have kept him honest, even had native principle
	been insufficient, was very justly regarded as perhaps the greatest
	criminal of all. His case was entered into on the day succeeding the
	acquittal of Mr. Stanhope. Great excitement prevailed, and the lobbies and
	avenues of the House were beset by crowds, impatient to know the result.
	The debate lasted the whole day. Mr. Aislabie found few friends: his guilt
	was so apparent and so heinous that nobody had courage to stand up in his
	favour. It was finally resolved, without a dissentient voice, that Mr.
	Aislabie had encouraged and promoted the destructive execution of the
	South-Sea scheme with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and had
	combined with the directors in their pernicious practices, to the ruin of
	the public trade and credit of the kingdom: that he should for his
	offences be ignominiously expelled from the House of Commons, and
	committed a close prisoner to the Tower of London; that he should be
	restrained from going out of the kingdom for a whole year, or till the end
	of the next session of Parliament; and that he should make <a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"></a>out a correct
	account of all his estate, in order that it might be applied to the relief
	of those who had suffered by his mal-practices.</p>

	<p>This verdict caused the greatest joy. Though it was delivered at half-past
	twelve at night, it soon spread over the city. Several persons illuminated
	their houses in token of their joy. On the following day, when Mr.
	Aislabie was conveyed to the Tower, the mob assembled on Tower-hill with
	the intention of hooting and pelting him. Not succeeding in this, they
	kindled a large bonfire, and danced around it in the exuberance of their
	delight. Several bonfires were made in other places; London presented the
	appearance of a holiday, and people congratulated one another as if they
	had just escaped from some great calamity. The rage upon the acquittal of
	Mr. Stanhope had grown to such a height that none could tell where it
	would have ended, had Mr. Aislabie met with the like indulgence.</p>

	<p>To increase the public satisfaction, Sir George Caswall, of the firm of
	Turner, Caswall, and Co., was expelled from the House on the following
	day, committed to the Tower, and ordered to refund the sum of 250,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr></p>

	<div class="figleft" style="width:161px">

		<p class="caption">EARL OF SUNDERLAND.</p>
	</div>

	<p>That part of the report of the Committee of Secrecy which related to the
	Earl of Sunderland was next taken into consideration. Every effort was
	made to clear his lordship from the imputation. As the case against him
	rested chiefly on the evidence extorted from Sir John Blunt, great pains
	were taken to make it appear that Sir John’s word was not to be believed,
	especially in a matter affecting the honour of a peer and privy
	councillor. All the friends of the ministry rallied around the earl, it
	being generally reported that a verdict of guilty against him would bring
	a Tory ministry into power. He was eventually acquitted by a majority of
	233 against 172; but the country was convinced of his guilt. The greatest
	indignation was every where expressed, and menacing mobs again assembled
	in London. Happily no disturbance took place.</p>

	<p>This was the day on which Mr. Craggs the elder expired. The morrow had
	been appointed for the consideration of his case. It was very generally
	believed that he had poisoned himself. It appeared, however, that grief
	for the loss of his son, one of the secretaries of <a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"></a>the Treasury, who had
	died five weeks previously of the small-pox, preyed much on his mind. For
	this son, dearly beloved, he had been amassing vast heaps of riches: he
	had been getting money, but not honestly; and he for whose sake he had
	bartered his honour and sullied his fame was now no more. The dread of
	further exposure increased his trouble of mind, and ultimately brought on
	an apoplectic fit, in which he expired. He left a fortune of a million and
	a half, which was afterwards confiscated for the benefit of the sufferers
	by the unhappy delusion he had been so mainly instrumental in raising.</p>

	<p>One by one the case of every director of the company was taken into
	consideration. A sum amounting to two millions and fourteen thousand
	pounds was confiscated from their estates towards repairing the mischief
	they had done, each man being allowed a certain residue in proportion to
	his conduct and circumstances, with which he might begin the world anew.
	Sir John Blunt was only allowed 5,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> out of his fortune of upwards of
	183,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; Sir John Fellows was allowed 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> out of 243,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; Sir
	Theodore Janssen, 50,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> out of 243,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; Mr. Edward Gibbon, 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>
	out of 106,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>; Sir John Lambert, 5000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> out of 72,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> Others, less
	deeply involved, were treated with greater liberality. Gibbon, the
	historian, whose grandfather was the Mr. Edward Gibbon so severely
	mulcted, has given, in the <cite>Memoirs of his Life and Writings</cite>, an
	interesting account of the proceedings in parliament at this time. He owns
	that he is not an unprejudiced witness; but, as all the writers from which
	it is possible to extract any notice of the proceedings of these
	disastrous years were prejudiced on the other side, the statements of the
	great historian become of additional value. If only on the principle <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">audi
	alteram partem</em>, his opinion is entitled to consideration. “In the year
	1716,” he says, “my grandfather was elected one of the directors of the
	South-Sea company, and his books exhibited the proof that before his
	acceptance of that fatal office, he had acquired an independent fortune of
	60,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> But his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year
	1720, and the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day. Of the
	use or abuse of the South-Sea scheme, of the guilt or innocence of my
	grandfather and his brother directors, I am neither a competent nor a
	disinterested judge. Yet the equity of modern times must condemn the
	violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would have disgraced the cause of
	justice, and rendered injustice still more odious. No sooner had the
	nation awakened from its golden dream, than a popular and even a
	parliamentary clamour demanded its victims; but it was acknowledged on all
	sides, that the directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any
	known <a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"></a>laws of the land. The intemperate notions of Lord Molesworth were
	not literally acted on; but a bill of pains and penalties was
	introduced—a retro-active statute, to punish the offences which did not
	exist at the time they were committed. The legislature restrained the
	persons of the directors, imposed an exorbitant security for their
	appearance, and marked their character with a previous note of ignominy.
	They were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the strict value of their
	estates, and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any
	part of their property. Against a bill of pains and penalties, it is the
	common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar. They
	prayed to be heard. Their prayer was refused, and their oppressors, who
	required no evidence, would listen to no defence. It had been at first
	proposed, that one-eighth of their respective estates should be allowed
	for the future support of the directors; but it was especially urged that,
	in the various shades of opulence and guilt, such a proportion would be
	too light for many, and for some might possibly be too heavy. The
	character and conduct of each man were separately weighed; but, instead of
	the calm solemnity of a judicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of
	thirty-three Englishmen were made the topics of hasty conversation, the
	sport of a lawless majority; and the basest member of the committee, <a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"></a>by a
	malicious word or a silent vote, might indulge his general spleen or
	personal animosity. Injury was aggravated by insult, and insult was
	embittered by pleasantry. Allowances of 20<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> or 1<abbr class="foreign" title="shilling">s.</abbr> were facetiously
	moved. A vague report that a director had formerly been concerned in
	another project, by which some unknown persons had lost their money, was
	admitted as a proof of his actual guilt. One man was ruined because he had
	dropped a foolish speech, that his horses should feed upon gold; another,
	because he was grown so proud, that one day, at the Treasury, he had
	refused a civil answer to persons much above him. All were condemned,
	absent and unheard, in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away
	the greatest part of their substance. Such bold oppression can scarcely be
	shielded by the omnipotence of parliament. My grandfather could not expect
	to be treated with more lenity than his companions. His Tory principles
	and connexions rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers. His name was
	reported in a suspicious secret. His well-known abilities could not plead
	the excuse of ignorance or error. In the first proceedings against the
	South-Sea directors, Mr. Gibbon was one of the first taken into custody,
	and in the final sentence the measure of his fine proclaimed him eminently
	guilty. The total estimate, which he delivered on oath to the House of
	Commons, amounted to 106,543<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> 5<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr class="foreign" title="pence">d.</abbr>, exclusive of antecedent
	settlements. Two different allowances of 15,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> and of 10,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> were
	moved for Mr. Gibbon; but on the question being put, it was carried
	without a division for the smaller sum. On these ruins, with the skill and
	credit of which parliament had not been able to despoil him, my
	grandfather, at a mature age, erected the edifice of a new fortune. The
	labours of sixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reason to believe
	that the second structure was not much inferior to the first.”</p>

	<p>The next consideration of the legislature, after the punishment of the
	directors, was to restore public credit. The scheme of Walpole had been
	found insufficient, and had fallen into disrepute. A computation was made
	of the whole capital stock of the South-Sea company at the end of the year
	1720. It was found to amount to thirty-seven millions eight hundred
	thousand pounds, of which the stock allotted to all the proprietors only
	amounted to twenty-four millions five hundred thousand pounds. The
	remainder of thirteen millions three hundred thousand pounds belonged to
	the company in their corporate capacity, and was the profit they had made
	by the national delusion. Upwards of eight millions of this were taken
	from the company, and divided among the proprietors and subscribers
	generally, making a dividend of about 33<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> 6<abbr class="foreign" title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr class="foreign" title="pence">d.</abbr> per cent. This was a
	great <a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"></a>relief. It was further ordered, that such persons as had borrowed
	money from the South-Sea company upon stock actually transferred and
	pledged at the time of borrowing to or for the use of the company, should
	be free from all demands, upon payment of ten per cent of the sums so
	borrowed. They had lent about eleven millions in this manner, at a time
	when prices were unnaturally raised; and they now received back one
	million one hundred thousand, when prices had sunk to their ordinary
	level.</p>

	<p>But it was a long time before public credit was thoroughly restored.
	Enterprise, like Icarus, had soared too high, and melted the wax of her
	wings; like Icarus, she had fallen into a sea, and learned, while
	floundering in its waves, that her proper element was the solid ground.
	She has never since attempted so high a flight.</p>

	<p>In times of great commercial prosperity there has been a tendency to
	over-speculation on several occasions since then. The success of one
	project generally produces others of a similar kind. Popular imitativeness
	will always, in a trading nation, seize hold of such successes, and drag a
	community too anxious for profits into an abyss from which extrication is
	difficult. Bubble companies, of a kind similar to those engendered by the
	South-Sea project, lived their little day in the famous year of the panic,
	1825. On that occasion, as in 1720, knavery gathered a rich harvest from
	cupidity, but both suffered when the day of reckoning came. The schemes of
	the year 1836 threatened, at one time, results as disastrous; but they
	were happily averted before it was too late.<a href="#fn27" id="fnm27" title="The South-Sea project..." class="fnmarker">27</a></p>

	</div>
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> tulip,—so named, it is said, from a Turkish word, signifying a
	turban,—was introduced into western Europe about the middle of the
	sixteenth century. Conrad Gesner, who claims the merit of having brought
	it into repute,—little dreaming of the commotion it was shortly
	afterwards to make in the world,—says that he first saw it in the year
	1559, in a garden at Augsburg, belonging to the learned Counsellor
	Herwart, a man very famous in his day for his collection of rare exotics.
	The bulbs were sent to this gentleman by a friend at Constantinople, where
	the flower had long been a favourite. In the course of ten or eleven years
	after this period, tulips were much sought after by the wealthy,
	especially in Holland and Germany. Rich people at Amsterdam sent for the
	bulbs direct to Constantinople, and paid the most extravagant prices for
	them. The first roots planted in England were brought from Vienna in 1600.
	Until the year 1634 the tulip annually increased in reputation, until it
	was deemed a proof of bad taste in any man of fortune to be without a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"></a>collection of them. Many learned men, including Pompeius de Angelis and
	the celebrated Lipsius of Leyden, the author of the treatise “De
	Constantia,” were passionately fond of tulips. The rage for possessing
	them soon caught the middle classes of society, and merchants and
	shopkeepers, even of moderate means, began to vie with each other in the
	rarity of these flowers and the preposterous prices they paid for them. A
	trader at Harlaem was known to pay one-half of his fortune for a single
	root, not with the design of selling it again at a profit, but to keep in
	his own conservatory for the admiration of his acquaintance.</p>

	<p>One would suppose that there must have been some great virtue in this
	flower to have made it so valuable in the eyes of so prudent a people as
	the Dutch; but it has neither the beauty nor the perfume of the
	rose—hardly the beauty of the “sweet, sweet-pea;” neither is it as
	enduring as either. Cowley, it is true, is loud in its praise. He says—</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“The tulip next appeared, all over gay,</p>
		<p>But wanton, full of pride, and full of play;</p>
		<p>The world can’t shew a dye but here has place;</p>
		<p>Nay, by new mixtures, she can change her face;</p>
		<p>Purple and gold are both beneath her care,</p>
		<p>The richest needlework she loves to wear;</p>
		<p>Her only study is to please the eye,</p>
		<p>And to outshine the rest in finery.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>This, though not very poetical, is the description of a poet. Beckmann, in
	his <cite>History of Inventions</cite>, paints it with more fidelity, and in prose
	more pleasing than Cowley’s poetry. He says, “There are few plants which
	acquire, through accident, weakness, or disease, so many variegations as
	the tulip. When uncultivated, and in its natural state, it is almost of
	one colour, has large leaves, and an extraordinarily long stem. When it
	has been weakened by cultivation, it becomes more agreeable in the eyes of
	the florist. The petals are then paler, smaller, and more diversified in
	hue; and the leaves acquire a softer green colour. Thus this masterpiece
	of culture, the more beautiful it turns, grows so much the weaker, so
	that, with the greatest skill and most careful attention, it can scarcely
	be transplanted, or even kept alive.”</p>

	<p>Many persons grow insensibly attached to that which gives them a great
	deal of trouble, as a mother often loves her sick and ever-ailing child
	better than her more healthy offspring. Upon the same principle we must
	account for the unmerited encomia lavished upon these fragile blossoms. In
	1634, the rage among the Dutch to possess them was so great that the
	ordinary industry of the country was <a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"></a>neglected, and the population, even
	to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade. As the mania increased,
	prices augmented, until, in the year 1635, many persons were known to
	invest a fortune of 100,000 florins in the purchase of forty roots. It
	then became necessary to sell them by their weight in <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>, a small
	weight less than a grain. A tulip of the species called <em class="cultivar">Admiral Liefken</em>,
	weighing 400 <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>, was worth 4400 florins; an <em class="cultivar">Admiral Van der Eyck</em>,
	weighing 446 <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>, was worth 1260 florins; a <em class="cultivar">Childer</em> of 106 <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>
	was worth 1615 florins; a <em class="cultivar">Viceroy</em> of 400 <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>, 3000 florins, and,
	most precious of all, a <em class="cultivar">Semper Augustus</em>, weighing 200 <em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perits</em>, was
	thought to be very cheap at 5500 florins. The latter was much sought
	after, and even an inferior bulb might command a price of 2000 florins. It
	is related that, at one time, early in 1636, there were only two roots of
	this description to be had in all Holland, and those not of the best. One
	was in the possession of a dealer in Amsterdam, and the other in Harlaem.
	So anxious were the speculators to obtain them, that one person offered
	the fee-simple of twelve acres of building-ground for the Harlaem tulip.
	That of Amsterdam was bought for 4600 florins, a new carriage, two grey
	horses, and a complete suit of harness. Hunting, an industrious author of
	that day, who wrote a folio volume of one thousand pages upon the
	tulipomania, has preserved the folio wing list of the various articles,
	and their value, which were delivered for one single root of the rare
	species called the <em class="cultivar">Viceroy</em>:</p>

	<p>People who had been absent from Holland, and whose chance it was to return
	when this folly was at its maximum, were sometimes led into awkward
	dilemmas by their ignorance. There is an amusing instance of the kind
	related in Blainville’s <cite>Travels</cite>. A wealthy merchant, who prided himself
	not a little on his rare tulips, received upon one occasion a very
	valuable consignment of merchandise from the Levant. Intelligence of its
	arrival was brought him by a sailor, who presented himself for that
	purpose at the counting-house, <a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"></a>bales of goods of every description.
	The merchant, to reward him for his news, munificently made him a present
	of a fine red herring for his breakfast. The sailor had, it appears, a
	great partiality for onions, and seeing a bulb very like an onion lying
	upon the counter of this liberal trader, and thinking it, no doubt, very
	much out of its place among silks and velvets, he slily seized an
	opportunity and slipped it into his pocket, as a relish for his herring.
	He got clear off with his prize, and proceeded to the quay to eat his
	breakfast. Hardly was his back turned when the merchant missed his
	valuable <em class="cultivar">Semper Augustus</em>, worth three thousand florins, or about 280<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr>
	sterling. The whole establishment was instantly in an uproar; search was
	every where made for the precious root, but it was not to be found. Great
	was the merchant’s distress of mind. The search was renewed, but again
	without success. At last some one thought of the sailor.</p>

	<p>The unhappy merchant sprang into the street at the bare suggestion. His
	alarmed household followed him. The sailor, simple soul! had not thought
	of concealment. He was found quietly sitting on a coil of ropes,
	masticating the last morsel of his “<em>onion</em>”. Little did he dream that he
	had been eating a breakfast whose cost might have regaled a whole ship’s
	crew for a twelvemonth; or, as the plundered merchant himself expressed
	it, “might have sumptuously feasted the Prince of Orange and the whole
	court of the Stadtholder.” Anthony caused pearls to be dissolved in wine
	to drink the health of Cleopatra; Sir Richard Whittington was as foolishly
	magnificent in an entertainment to King Henry V.; and Sir Thomas Gresham
	drank a diamond dissolved in wine to the health of Queen Elizabeth, when
	she opened the Royal Exchange; but the breakfast of this roguish Dutchman
	was as splendid as either. He had an advantage, too, over his wasteful
	predecessors: <em>their</em> gems did not improve the taste or the wholesomeness
	of <em>their</em> wine, while <em>his</em> tulip was quite delicious with his red
	herring. The most unfortunate part of the business for him was, that he
	remained in prison for some months on a charge of felony preferred against
	him by the merchant.</p>

	<p>Another story is told of an English traveller, which is scarcely less
	ludicrous. This gentleman, an amateur botanist, happened to see a
	tulip-root lying in the conservatory of a wealthy Dutchman. Being ignorant
	of its quality, he took out his penknife, and peeled off its coats, with
	the view of making experiments upon it. When it was by this means reduced
	to half its size, he cut it into two equal sections, making all the time
	many learned remarks on the singular appearances of the unknown bulb.
	Suddenly, the owner pounced upon him, and, with fury in his eyes, asked
	him if he knew what he had been doing? “Peeling a most extraordinary
	onion,” replied the <a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"></a>philosopher. “<em lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hundert tausend duyvel!</em>” said the
	Duchman; “it’s an <em class="cultivar">Admiral Van der Eyck</em>.” “Thank you,” replied the
	traveller, taking out his note-book to make a memorandum of the same; “are
	these admirals common in your country?” “Death and the devil!” said the
	Dutchman, seizing the astonished man of science by the collar; “come
	before the syndic, and you shall see.” In spite of his remonstrances, the
	traveller was led through the streets followed by a mob of persons. When
	brought into the presence of the magistrate, he learned, to his
	consternation, that the root upon which he had been experimentalising was
	worth four thousand florins; and, notwithstanding all he could urge in
	extenuation, he was lodged in prison until he found securities for the
	payment of this sum.</p>

	<p>The demand for tulips of a rare species increased so much in the year
	1636, that regular marts for their sale were established on the Stock
	Exchange of Amsterdam, in Rotterdam, Harlaem, Leyden, Alkmar, Hoorn, and
	other towns. Symptoms of gambling now became, for the first time,
	apparent. The stock-jobbers, ever on the alert for a new speculation,
	dealt largely in tulips, making use of all the means they so well knew how
	to employ, to cause fluctuations in prices. At first, as in all these
	gambling mania, confidence was at its height, and every body gained. The
	tulip-jobbers speculated in the rise and fall of the tulip stocks, and
	made large profits by buying when prices fell, and selling out when they
	rose. Many individuals grew suddenly rich. A golden bait hung temptingly
	out before the people, and one after the other, they rushed to the
	tulip-marts, like flies around a honey-pot. Every one imagined that the
	passion for tulips would last for ever, and that the wealthy from every
	part of the world would send to Holland, and pay whatever prices were
	asked for them. The riches of Europe would be concentrated on the shores
	of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty banished from the favoured clime of
	Holland. Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, sea-men, footmen,
	maid-servants, even chimney-sweeps and old clothes-women, dabbled in
	tulips. People of all grades converted their property into cash, and
	invested it in flowers. Houses and lands were offered for sale at
	ruinously low prices, or assigned in payment of bargains made at the
	tulip-mart. Foreigners became smitten with the same frenzy, and money
	poured into Holland from all directions. The prices of the necessaries of
	life rose again by degrees: houses and lands, horses and carriages, and
	luxuries of every sort, rose in value with them, and for some months
	Holland seemed the very antechamber of Plutus. The operations of the trade
	became so extensive and so intricate, that it was found necessary to draw
	up a code of laws for the guidance of the dealers. Notaries and clerks
	were also <a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"></a>appointed, who devoted themselves exclusively to the interests
	of the trade. The designation of public notary was hardly known in some
	towns, that of tulip-notary usurping its place. In the smaller towns,
	where there was no exchange, the principal tavern was usually selected as
	the “show-place,” where high and low traded in tulips, and confirmed their
	bargains over sumptuous entertainments. These dinners were sometimes
	attended by two or three hundred persons, and large vases of tulips, in
	full bloom, were placed at regular intervals upon the tables and
	sideboards for their gratification during the repast.</p>

	<p>At last, however, the more prudent began to see that this folly could not
	last for ever. Rich people no longer bought the flowers to keep them in
	their gardens, but to sell them again at cent per cent profit. It was seen
	that somebody must lose fearfully in the end. As this conviction spread,
	prices fell, and never rose again. Confidence was destroyed, and a
	universal panic seized upon the dealers. <em>A</em> had agreed to purchase ten
	<em class="cultivar">Semper Augustines</em> from <em>B</em>, at four thousand florins each, at six weeks
	after the signing of the contract. <em>B</em> was ready with the flowers at the
	appointed time; but the price had fallen to three or four hundred florins,
	and <em>A</em> refused either to pay the difference or receive the tulips.
	Defaulters were announced day after day in all the towns of Holland.
	Hundreds who, a few months previously, had begun to doubt that there was
	such a thing as poverty in the land, suddenly found themselves the
	possessors of a few bulbs, which nobody would buy, even though they
	offered them at one quarter of the sums they had paid for them. The cry of
	distress resounded every where, and each man accused his neighbour. The
	few who had contrived to enrich themselves hid their wealth from the
	knowledge of their fellow-citizens, and invested it in the English or
	other funds. Many who, for a brief season, had emerged from the humbler
	walks of life, were cast back into their original obscurity. Substantial
	merchants were reduced almost to beggary, and many a representative of a
	noble line saw the fortunes of his house ruined beyond redemption.</p>

	<p>When the first alarm subsided, the tulip-holders in the several towns held
	public meetings to devise what measures, were best to be taken to restore
	public credit. It was generally agreed, that deputies should be sent from
	all parts to Amsterdam, to consult with the government upon some remedy
	for the evil. The government at first refused to interfere, but advised
	the tulip-holders to agree to some plan among themselves. Several meetings
	were held for this purpose; but no measure could be devised likely to give
	satisfaction to the deluded people, or repair even a slight portion of the
	mischief that had <a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"></a>been done. The language of complaint and reproach was in
	every body’s mouth, and all the meetings were of the most stormy
	character. At last, however, after much bickering and ill-will, it was
	agreed, at Amsterdam, by the assembled deputies, that all contracts made
	in the height of the mania, or prior to the month of November 1636, should
	be declared null and void, and that, in those made after that date,
	purchasers should be freed from their engagements, on paying ten per cent
	to the vendor. This decision gave no satisfaction. The vendors who had
	their tulips on hand were, of course, discontented, and those who had
	pledged themselves to purchase, thought themselves hardly treated. Tulips
	which had, at one time, been worth six thousand florins, were now to be
	procured for five hundred; so that the composition of ten per cent was one
	hundred florins more than the actual value. Actions for breach of contract
	were threatened in all the courts of the country; but the latter refused
	to take cognisance of gambling transactions.</p>

	<p>The matter was finally referred to the Provincial Council at the Hague,
	and it was confidently expected that the wisdom of this body would invent
	some measure by which credit should be restored. Expectation was on the
	stretch for its decision, but it never came. The members continued to
	deliberate week after week, and at last, after thinking about it for three
	months, declared that they could offer no final decision until they had
	more information. They advised, however, that, in the mean time, every
	vendor should, in the presence of witnesses, offer the tulips <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in natura</em>
	to the purchaser for the sums agreed upon. If the latter refused to take
	them, they might be put up for sale by public auction, and the original
	contractor held responsible for the difference between the actual and the
	stipulated price. This was exactly the plan recommended by the deputies,
	and which was already shewn to be of no avail. There was no court in
	Holland which would enforce payment. The question was raised in Amsterdam,
	but the judges unanimously refused to interfere, on the ground that debts
	contracted in gambling were no debts in law.</p>

	<p>Thus the matter rested. To find a remedy was beyond the power of the
	government. Those who were unlucky enough to have had stores of tulips on
	hand at the time of the sudden reaction were left to bear their ruin as
	philosophically as they could; those who had made profits were allowed to
	keep them; but the commerce of the country suffered a severe shock, from
	which it was many years ere it recovered.</p>

	<p>The example of the Dutch was imitated to some extent in England. In the
	year 1636 tulips were publicly sold in the Exchange of London, and the
	jobbers exerted themselves to the utmost to raise <a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"></a>them to the fictitious
	value they had acquired in Amsterdam. In Paris also the jobbers strove to
	create a tulipomania. In both cities they only partially succeeded.
	However, the force of example brought the flowers into great favour, and
	amongst a certain class of people tulips have ever since been prized more
	highly than any other flowers of the field. The Dutch are still notorious
	for their partiality to them, and continue to pay higher prices for them
	than any other people. As the rich Englishman boasts of his fine
	race-horses or his old pictures, so does the wealthy Dutchman vaunt him of
	his tulips.</p>

	<p>In England, in our day, strange as it may appear, a tulip will produce
	more money than an oak. If one could be found, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara in terris</em>, and black
	as the black swan of Juvenal, its price would equal that of a dozen acres
	of standing corn. In Scotland, towards the close of the seventeenth
	century, the highest price for tulips, according to the authority of a
	writer in the supplement to the third edition of the <cite>Encyclopedia
	Britannica</cite>, was ten guineas. Their value appears to have diminished from
	that time till the year 1769, when the two most valuable species in
	England were the <em class="cultivar">Don Quevedo</em> and the <em class="cultivar">Valentinier</em>, the former of which
	was worth two guineas and the latter two guineas and a half. These prices
	appear to have been the minimum. In the year 1800, a common price was
	fifteen guineas for a single bulb. In 1835, a bulb of the species called
	the Miss Fanny Kemble was sold by public auction in London for
	seventy-five pounds. Still more remarkable was the price of a tulip in the
	possession of a gardener in the King’s Road, Chelsea;—in his catalogues

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Dissatisfaction</span> with his lot seems to be the characteristic of man in all
	ages and climates. So far, however, from being an evil, as at first might
	be supposed, it has been the great civiliser of our race; and has tended,
	more than any thing else, to raise us above the condition of the brutes.
	But the same discontent which has been the source of all improvement, has
	been the parent of no small progeny of follies and absurdities; to trace
	these latter is our present object. <a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"></a>Vast as the subject appears, it is
	easily reducible within such limits as will make it comprehensive without
	being wearisome, and render its study both instructive and amusing.</p>

	<p>Three causes especially have excited the discontent of mankind; and, by
	impelling us to seek for remedies for the irremediable, have bewildered us
	in a maze of madness and error. These are death, toil, and ignorance of
	the future—the doom of man upon this sphere, and for which he shews his
	antipathy by his love of life, his longing for abundance, and his craving
	curiosity to pierce the secrets of the days to come. The first has led
	many to imagine that they might find means to avoid death, or failing in
	this, that they might, nevertheless, so prolong existence as to reckon it
	by centuries instead of units. From this sprang the search, so long
	continued and still pursued, for the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>, or <em>water of life</em>,
	which has led thousands to pretend to it and millions to believe in it.
	From the second sprang the search for the philosopher’s stone, which was
	to create plenty by changing all metals into gold; and from the third, the
	false sciences of astrology, divination, and their divisions of
	necromancy, chiromancy, augury, with all their train of signs, portents,
	and omens.</p>

	<p>In tracing the career of the erring philosophers, or the wilful cheats,
	who have encouraged or preyed upon the credulity of mankind, it will
	simplify and elucidate the subject, if we divide it into three classes:
	the first comprising alchymists, or those in general who have devoted
	themselves to the discovering of the philosopher’s stone and the water of
	life; the second comprising astrologers, necromancers, sorcerers,
	geomancers, and all those who pretended to discover futurity; and the
	third consisting of the dealers in charms, amulets, philters,
	universal-panacea mongers, touchers for the evil, seventh sons of a
	seventh son, sympathetic powder compounders, homœopathists, animal
	magnetisers, and all the motley tribe of quacks, empirics, and charlatans.</p>

	<p>But in narrating the career of such men, it will be found that many of
	them united several or all of the functions just mentioned; that the
	alchymist was a fortune-teller, or a necromancer—that he pretended to
	cure all maladies by touch or charm, and to work miracles of every kind.
	In the dark and early ages of European history this is more especially the
	case. Even as we advance to more recent periods, we shall find great
	difficulty in separating the characters. The alchymist seldom confined
	himself strictly to his pretended science—the sorcerer and necromancer to
	theirs, or the medical charlatan to his. Beginning with alchymy, some
	confusion of these classes is unavoidable; but the ground will clear for
	us as we advance.</p>

	<p>Let us not, in the pride of our superior knowledge, turn with <a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"></a>contempt
	from the follies of our predecessors. The study of the errors into which
	great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be
	uninstructive. As the man looks back to the days of his childhood and his
	youth, and recalls to his mind the strange notions and false opinions that
	swayed his actions at that time, that he may wonder at them; so should
	society, for its edification, look back to the opinions which governed the
	ages fled. He is but a superficial thinker who would despise and refuse to
	hear of them merely because they are absurd. No man is so wise but that he
	may learn some wisdom from his past errors, either of thought or action;
	and no society has made such advances as to be capable of no improvement
	from the retrospect of its past folly and credulity. And not only is such
	a study instructive: he who reads for amusement only will find no chapter
	in the annals of the human mind more amusing than this. It opens out the
	whole realm of fiction—the wild, the fantastic, and the wonderful, and
	all the immense variety of things “that are not, and cannot be; but that
	have been imagined and believed.”</p>

	<hr class="short" />

	<p>For more than a thousand years the art of alchymy captivated many noble
	spirits, and was believed in by millions. Its origin is involved in
	obscurity. Some of its devotees have claimed for it an antiquity coeval
	with the creation of man himself, others, again, would trace it no further
	back than the time of Noah. Vincent de Beauvais argues, indeed, that all
	the antediluvians must have possessed a knowledge of alchymy; and
	particularly cites Noah as having been acquainted with the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>,
	or he could not have lived to so prodigious an age, and have begotten
	children when upwards of five hundred. Lenglet du Fresnoy, in his <cite>History
	of the Hermetic Philosophy</cite>, says, “Most of them pretended that Shem, or
	Chem, the son of Noah, was an adept in the art, and thought it highly
	probable that the words <em>chemistry</em> and <em>alchymy</em> are both derived from
	his name.” Others say, the art was derived from the Egyptians, amongst
	whom it was first founded by Hermes Trismegistus. Moses, who is looked
	upon as a first-rate alchymist, gained his knowledge in Egypt; but he kept
	it all to himself, and would not instruct the children of Israel in its
	mysteries. All the writers upon alchymy triumphantly cite the story of the
	golden calf, in the 32d chapter of Exodus, to prove that this great
	lawgiver was an adept, and could make or unmake gold at his pleasure. It
	is recorded, that Moses was so wrath with the Israelites for their
	idolatry, “that he took the calf which they had made, and burned it in the
	fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon <a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"></a>the water, and made the
	children of Israel drink of it.” This, say the alchymists, he never could
	have done had he not been in possession of the philosopher’s stone; by no
	other means could he have made the powder of gold float upon the water.
	But we must leave this knotty point for the consideration of the adepts in
	the art, if any such there be, and come to more modern periods of its
	history. The Jesuit, Father Martini, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Sinica</cite>, says, it
	was practised by the Chinese two thousand five hundred years before the
	birth of Christ; but his assertion, being unsupported, is worth nothing.
	It would appear, however, that pretenders to the art of making gold and
	silver existed in Rome in the first centuries after the Christian era, and
	that, when discovered, they were liable to punishment as knaves and
	impostors. At Constantinople, in the fourth century, the transmutation of
	metals was very generally believed in, and many of the Greek ecclesiastics
	wrote treatises upon the subject. Their names are preserved, and some
	notice of their works given, in the third volume of Langlet du Fresnoy’s
	<cite>History of the Hermetic Philosophy</cite>. Their notion appears to have been,
	that all metals were composed of two substances; the one, metallic earth;
	and the other, a red inflammable matter, which they called sulphur. The
	pure union of these substances formed gold; but other metals were mixed
	with and contaminated by various foreign ingredients. The object of the
	philosopher’s stone was to dissolve or neutralise all these ingredients,
	by which iron, lead, copper, and all metals would be transmuted into the
	original gold. Many learned and clever men wasted their time, their
	health, and their energies, in this vain pursuit; but for several
	centuries it took no great hold upon the imagination of the people. The
	history of the delusion appears, in a manner, lost from this time till the
	eighth century, when it appeared amongst the Arabians. From this period it
	becomes easier to trace its progress. A master then appeared, who was long
	looked upon as the father of the science, and whose name is indissolubly
	connected with it.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Geber.</h3>
	
	<p>Of this philosopher, who devoted his life to the study of alchymy, but few
	particulars are known. He is thought to have lived in the year 730. His
	true name was Abou Moussah Djafar, to which was added Al Sofi, or “The
	Wise,” and he was born at Houran, in Mesopotamia.<a href="#fn28" id="fnm28" title="Biographie Universelle." class="fnmarker">28</a> Some have thought
	he was a Greek, others a Spaniard, and others a prince of Hindostan; but
	of all the mistakes which have been made respecting him, the most
	ludicrous was that made by the French translator of Sprenger’s <cite>History of
	Medicine</cite>, who thought, <a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"></a>from the sound of his name, that he was a German,
	and rendered it as the “Donnateur,” or Giver. No details of his life are
	known; but it is asserted, that he wrote more than five hundred works upon
	the philosopher’s stone and the water of life. He was a great enthusiast
	in his art, and compared the incredulous to little children shut up in a
	narrow room, without windows or aperture, who, because they saw nothing
	beyond, denied the existence of the great globe itself. He thought that a
	preparation of gold would cure all maladies, not only in man, but in the
	inferior animals and plants. He also imagined that all the metals laboured
	under disease, with the exception of gold, which was the only one in
	perfect health. He affirmed, that the secret of the philosopher’s stone
	had been more than once discovered; but that the ancient and wise men who
	had hit upon it would never, by word or writing, communicate it to men,
	because of their unworthiness and incredulity.<a href="#fn29" id="fnm29" title="His sum 'of perfection,'..." class="fnmarker">29</a> But the life of Geber,
	though spent in the pursuit of this vain chimera, was not altogether
	useless. He stumbled upon discoveries which he did not seek; and science
	is indebted to him for the first mention of corrosive sublimate, the red
	oxide of mercury, nitric acid, and the nitrate of silver.<a href="#fn30" id="fnm30" title="Article, Geber..." class="fnmarker">30</a></p>

	<p>For more than two hundred years after the death of Geber, the Arabian
	philosophers devoted themselves to the study of alchymy, joining with it
	that of astrology. Of these the most celebrated was</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Alfarabi.</h3>
	
	<p>Alfarabi flourished at the commencement of the tenth century, and enjoyed
	the reputation of being one of the most learned men of his age. He spent
	his life in travelling from country to country, that he might gather the
	opinions of philosophers upon the great secrets of nature. No danger
	dismayed him; no toil wearied him of the pursuit. Many sovereigns
	endeavoured to retain him at their courts; but he refused to rest until he
	had discovered the great object of his life—the art of preserving it for
	centuries, and of making gold as much as he needed. This wandering mode of
	life at last proved fatal to him. He had been on a visit to Mecca, not so
	much for religious as for philosophical purposes, when, returning through
	Syria, he stopped at the court of the Sultan Seifeddoulet, who was
	renowned <a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"></a>as the patron of learning. He presented himself in his travelling
	attire in the presence of that monarch and his courtiers; and, without
	invitation, coolly sat himself down on the sofa beside the prince. The
	courtiers and wise men were indignant; and the sultan, who did not know
	the intruder, was at first inclined to follow their example. He turned to
	one of his officers, and ordered him to eject the presumptuous stranger
	from the room; but Alfarabi, without moving, dared them to lay hands upon
	him; and, turning himself calmly to the prince, remarked, that he did not
	know who was his guest, or he would treat him with honour, not with
	violence. The sultan, instead of being still further incensed, as many
	potentates would have been, admired his coolness; and, requesting him to
	sit still closer to him on the sofa, entered into a long conversation with
	him upon science and divine philosophy. All the court were charmed with
	the stranger. Questions for discussion were propounded, on all of which he
	shewed superior knowledge. He convinced every one who ventured to dispute
	with him; and spoke so eloquently upon the science of alchymy, that he was
	at once recognised as only second to the great Geber himself. One of the
	doctors present inquired whether a man who knew so many sciences was
	acquainted with music? Alfarabi made no reply, but merely requested that a
	lute should be brought him. The lute was brought; and he played such
	ravishing and tender melodies, that all the court were melted into tears.
	He then changed his theme, and played airs so sprightly, that he set the
	grave philosophers, sultan and all, dancing as fast as their legs could
	carry them. He then sobered them again by a mournful strain, and made them
	sob and sigh as if broken-hearted. The sultan, highly delighted with his
	powers, entreated him to stay, offering him every inducement that wealth,
	power, and dignity could supply; but the alchymist resolutely refused, it
	being decreed, he said, that he should never repose till he had discovered
	the philosopher’s stone. He set out accordingly the same evening, and was
	murdered by some thieves in the deserts of Syria. His biographers give no
	further particulars of his life beyond mentioning that he wrote several
	valuable treatises on his art, all of which, however, have been lost. His
	death happened in the year 954.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Avicenna.</h3>
	
	<p>Avicenna, whose real name was Ebn Cinna, another great alchymist, was born
	at Bokhara in 980. His reputation as a physician and a man skilled in all
	sciences was so great, that the Sultan Magdal Douleth resolved to try his
	powers in the great science of government. He was accordingly made Grand
	Vizier of that prince, and ruled the <a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"></a>state with some advantage; but in a
	science still more difficult, he failed completely. He could not rule his
	own passions, but gave himself up to wine and women, and led a life of
	shameless debauchery. Amid the multifarious pursuits of business and
	pleasure, he nevertheless found time to write seven treatises upon the
	philosopher’s stone, which were for many ages looked upon as of great
	value by pretenders to the art. It is rare that an eminent physician as
	Avicenna appears to have been, abandons himself to sensual gratification;
	but so completely did he become enthralled in the course of a few years,
	that he was dismissed from his high office, and died shortly afterwards of
	premature old age and a complication of maladies, brought on by
	debauchery. His death took place in the year 1036. After his time few
	philosophers of any note in Arabia are heard of as devoting themselves to
	the study of alchymy; but it began shortly afterwards to attract greater
	attention in Europe. Learned men in France, England, Spain, and Italy,
	expressed their belief in the science, and many devoted their whole
	energies to it. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries especially, it was
	extensively pursued, and some of the brightest names of that age are
	connected with it. Among the most eminent of them are</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.</h3>

	<p>The first of these philosophers was born in the year 1193, of a noble
	family at Lawingen, in the Duchy of Neuburg, on the Danube. For the first
	thirty years of his life he appeared remarkably dull and stupid, and it
	was feared by every one that no good could come of him. He entered a
	Dominican monastery at an early age; but made so little progress in his
	studies, that he was more than once upon the point of abandoning them in
	despair, but he was endowed with extraordinary perseverance. As he
	advanced to middle age, his mind expanded, and he learned whatever he
	applied himself to with extreme facility. So remarkable a change was not
	in that age to be accounted for but by a miracle. It was asserted and
	believed that the Holy Virgin, touched with his great desire to become
	learned and famous, took pity upon his incapacity, and appeared to him in
	the cloister where he sat almost despairing, and asked him whether he
	wished to excel in philosophy or divinity. He chose philosophy, to the
	chagrin of the Virgin, who reproached him in mild and sorrowful accents
	that he had not made a better choice. She, however, granted his request,
	that he should become the most excellent philosopher of the age; but set
	this drawback to his pleasure, that he should relapse, when at the height
	of his fame, into his former incapacity and stupidity. Albertus never took
	the trouble to contradict the story, <a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"></a>but prosecuted his studies with such
	unremitting zeal, that his reputation speedily spread over all Europe. In
	the year 1244, the celebrated Thomas Aquinas placed himself under his
	tuition. Many extraordinary stories are told of the master and his pupil.
	While they paid all due attention to other branches of science, they never
	neglected the pursuit of the philosopher’s stone and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>.
	Although they discovered neither, it was believed that Albert had seized
	some portion of the secret of life, and found means to animate a brazen
	statue, upon the formation of which, under proper conjunctions of the
	planets, he had been occupied many years of his life. He and Thomas
	Aquinas completed it together, endowed it with the faculty of speech, and
	made it perform the functions of a domestic servant. In this capacity it
	was exceedingly useful; but, through some defect in the machinery, it
	chattered much more than was agreeable to either philosopher. Various
	remedies were tried to cure it of its garrulity, but in vain; and one day,
	Thomas Aquinas was so enraged at the noise it made when he was in the
	midst of a mathematical problem, that he seized a ponderous hammer and
	smashed it to pieces.<a href="#fn31" id="fnm31" title="Naudé..." class="fnmarker">31</a> He was sorry afterwards for what he had done,
	and was reproved by his master for giving way to his anger, so unbecoming
	in a philosopher. They made no attempt to re-animate the statue.</p>

		<a href="images/image35.png"><img src="images/th_image35.png" alt="A profile view." id="image35" width="138" height="126" /></a>
		<p class="caption">ALBERTUS MAGNUS.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Such stories as these shew the spirit of the age. Every great man who
	attempted to study the secrets of nature was thought a magician; and it is
	not to be wondered at that, when philosophers themselves pretended to
	discover an elixir for conferring immortality, or a red stone which was to
	create boundless wealth, that popular opinion should have enhanced upon
	their pretensions, and have endowed them with powers still more
	miraculous. It was believed of Albertus Magnus that he could even change
	the course of the seasons, a feat which the many thought less difficult
	than the discovery of the grand elixir. Albertus was desirous of obtaining
	a piece of ground on which to build a monastery in the neighbourhood of
	Cologne. The ground belonged to William Count of Holland and King of the
	Romans, who for some reason or other did not wish to part with it.
	Albertus is reported to have gained it by the following extraordinary
	method: <a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"></a>He invited the prince as he was passing through Cologne to a
	magnificent entertainment prepared for him and all his court. The prince
	accepted it, and repaired with a lordly retinue to the residence of the
	sage. It was in the midst of winter, the Rhine was frozen over, and the
	cold was so bitter, that the knights could not sit on horseback without
	running the risk of losing their toes by the frost. Great, therefore, was
	their surprise, on arriving at Albert’s house, to find that the repast was
	spread in his garden, in which the snow had drifted to the depth of
	several feet. The earl in high dudgeon remounted his steed, but Albert at
	last prevailed upon him to take his seat at the table. He had no sooner
	done so, than the dark clouds rolled away from the sky—a warm sun shone
	forth—the cold north wind veered suddenly round and blew a mild breeze
	from the south—the snows melted away—the ice was unbound upon the
	streams, and the trees put forth their green leaves and their
	fruit—flowers sprang up beneath their feet, while larks, nightingales,
	blackbirds, cuckoos, thrushes, and every sweet song-bird sang hymns from
	every tree. The earl and his attendants wondered greatly; but they ate
	their dinner, and in recompense for it, Albert got his piece of ground to
	build a convent on. He had not, however, shewn them all his power.
	Immediately that the repast was over, he gave the word, and dark clouds
	obscured the sun—the snow fell in large flakes—the singing-birds fell
	dead—the leaves dropped from the trees, and the winds blew so cold and
	howled so mournfully, that the guests wrapped themselves up in their thick
	cloaks, and retreated into the house to warm themselves at the blazing
	fire in Albert’s kitchen.<a href="#fn32" id="fnm32" title="Lenglet..." class="fnmarker">32</a></p>

	<p>Thomas Aquinas also could work wonders as well as his master. It is
	related of him that he lodged in a street at Cologne, where he was much
	annoyed by the incessant clatter made by the horses’ hoofs, as they were
	led through it daily to exercise by their grooms. He had entreated the
	latter to select some other spot, where they might not disturb a
	philosopher; but the grooms turned a deaf ear to all his solicitations. In
	this emergency he had recourse to the aid of magic. He constructed a small
	horse of bronze, upon which he inscribed certain cabalistic characters,
	and buried it at midnight in the midst of the highway. The next morning a
	troop of grooms came riding along as usual; but the horses, as they
	arrived at the spot where the magic horse was buried, reared and plunged
	violently—their nostrils distended with terror—their manes grew erect,
	and the perspiration ran down their sides in streams. In vain the riders
	applied the spur—in vain they coaxed or threatened, the animals would not
	pass the <a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"></a>spot. On the following day their success was no better. They were
	at length compelled to seek another spot for their exercise, and Thomas
	Aquinas was left in peace.<a href="#fn33" id="fnm33" title="Naudé" class="fnmarker">33</a></p>

	<p>Albertus Magnus was made Bishop of Ratisbon in 1259; but he occupied the
	see only four years, when he resigned, on the ground that its duties
	occupied too much of the time which he was anxious to devote to
	philosophy. He died in Cologne in 1280, at the advanced age of
	eighty-seven. The Dominican writers deny that he ever sought the
	philosopher’s stone, but his treatise upon minerals sufficiently proves
	that he did.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Artephius.</h3>

	<p>Artephius, a name noted in the annals of alchymy, was born in the early
	part of the twelfth century. He wrote two famous treatises; the one upon
	the philosopher’s stone, and the other on the art of prolonging human
	life. In the latter he vaunts his great qualifications for instructing
	mankind on such a matter, as he was at that time in the thousand and
	twenty-fifth year of his age! He had many disciples who believed in his
	extreme age, and who attempted to prove that he was Apollonius of Tyana,
	who lived soon after the advent of Jesus Christ, and the particulars of
	whose life and pretended miracles have been so fully described by
	Philostratus. He took good care never to contradict a story which so much
	increased the power he was desirous of wielding over his fellow-mortals.
	On all convenient occasions, he boasted of it; and having an excellent
	memory, a fertile imagination, and a thorough knowledge of all existing
	history, he was never at a loss for an answer when questioned as to the
	personal appearance, the manners, or the character of the great men of
	antiquity. He also pretended to have found the philosopher’s stone; and
	said that, in search of it, he had descended to hell, and seen the devil
	sitting on a throne of gold, with a legion of imps and fiends around him.
	His works on alchymy have been translated into French, and were published
	in Paris in 1609 or 1610.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Alain de Lisle.</h3>

	<p>Contemporary with Albertus Magnus was Alain de Lisle of Flanders, who was
	named, from his great learning, the “universal doctor.” He was thought to
	possess a knowledge of all the sciences, and, like Artephius, to have
	discovered the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>. He became one of the friars of the abbey of
	Citeaux, and died in 1298, aged about one hundred and ten years. It was
	said of him that he was at the point of death when in his fiftieth year,
	but that the fortunate discovery of <a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"></a>the elixir enabled him to add sixty
	years to his existence. He wrote a commentary on the prophecies of Merlin.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Arnold de Villeneuve.</h3>

	<p>This philosopher has left a much greater reputation. He was born in the
	year 1245, and studied medicine with great success in the university of
	Paris. He afterwards travelled for twenty years in Italy and Germany,
	where he made acquaintance with Pietro d’Apone, a man of a character akin
	to his own, and addicted to the same pursuits. As a physician, he was
	thought, in his own lifetime, to be the most able the world had ever seen.
	Like all the learned men of that day, he dabbled in astrology and alchymy,
	and was thought to have made immense quantities of gold from lead and
	copper. When Pietro d’Apone was arrested in Italy, and brought to trial as
	a sorcerer, a similar accusation was made against Arnold; but he managed
	to leave the country in time, and escape the fate of his unfortunate
	friend. He lost some credit by predicting the end of the world, but
	afterwards regained it. The time of his death is not exactly known; but it
	must have been prior to the year 1311, when Pope Clement V. wrote a
	circular letter to all the clergy of Europe who lived under his obedience,
	praying them to use their utmost efforts to discover the famous treatise
	of Arnold on <cite>The Practice of Medicine</cite>. The author had promised, during
	his lifetime, to make a present of the work to the Holy See, but died
	without fulfilling it.</p>

	</div>

	<p>In a very curious work by Monsieur Longeville Harcouet, entitled <cite>The
	History of the Persons who have lived several centuries and then grown
	young again</cite>, there is a receipt, said to have been given by Arnold de
	Villeneuve, by means of which any one might prolong his life for a few
	hundred years or so. In the first place, say Arnold and Monsieur Harcouet,
	“the person intending so to prolong his life must rub himself well, two or
	three times a week, with the juice or marrow of cassia (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moëlle de la
	casse</em>). Every night, upon going to bed, he must put upon his heart a
	plaster, composed of a certain quantity of oriental saffron, red
	rose-leaves, sandal-wood, aloes, and amber, liquified <a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"></a>in oil of roses and
	the best white wax. In the morning, he must take it off, and enclose it
	carefully in a leaden box till the next night, when it must be again
	applied. If he be of a sanguine temperament, he shall take sixteen
	chickens; if phlegmatic, twenty-five; and if melancholy, thirty, which he
	shall put into a yard where the air and the water are pure. Upon these he
	is to feed, eating one a day; but previously the chickens are to be
	fattened by a peculiar method, which will impregnate their flesh with the
	qualities that are to produce longevity in the eater. Being deprived of
	all other nourishment till they are almost dying of hunger, they are to be
	fed upon broth made of serpents and vinegar, which broth is to be
	thickened with wheat and bran.” Various ceremonies are to be performed in
	the cooking of this mess, which those may see in the book of M. Harcouet
	who are at all interested in the matter; and the chickens are to be fed
	upon it for two months. They are then fit for table, and are to be washed
	down with moderate quantities of good white wine or claret. This regimen
	is to be followed regularly every seven years, and any one may live to be
	as old as Methuselah! It is right to state that M. Harcouet has but little
	authority for attributing this precious composition to Arnold of
	Villeneuve. It is not found in the collected works of that philosopher;
	but was first brought to light by a M. Poirier, at the commencement of the
	sixteenth century, who asserted that he had discovered it in <abbr title="manuscript" class="small_all_caps">MS.</abbr> in the
	undoubted writing of Arnold.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Pietro d’Apone.</h3>

	<p>This unlucky sage was born at Apone, near Padua, in the year 1250. Like
	his friend Arnold de Villeneuve, he was an eminent physician, and a
	pretender to the arts of astrology and alchymy. He practised for many
	years in Paris, and made great wealth by killing and curing, and telling
	fortunes. In an evil day for him, he returned to his own country, with the
	reputation of being a magician of the first order. It was universally
	believed that he had drawn seven evil spirits from the infernal regions,
	whom he kept enclosed in seven crystal vases until he required their
	services, when he sent them forth to the ends of the earth to execute his
	pleasure. One spirit excelled in philosophy; a second, in alchymy; a
	third, in astrology; a fourth, in physic; a fifth, in poetry; a sixth, in
	music; and the seventh, in painting: and whenever Pietro wished for
	information or instruction in any of these arts, he had only to go to his
	crystal vase and liberate the presiding spirit. Immediately all the
	secrets of the art were revealed to him; and he might, if it pleased him,
	excel Homer in poetry, Apelles in painting, or Pythagoras himself in
	philosophy. Although he could make gold out of <a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"></a>brass, it was said of him
	that he was very sparing of his powers in that respect, and kept himself
	constantly supplied with money by other and less creditable means.
	Whenever he disbursed gold, he muttered a certain charm, known only to
	himself, and next morning the gold was safe again in his own possession.
	The trader to whom he gave it might lock it in his strong box and have it
	guarded by a troop of soldiers, but the charmed metal flew back to its old
	master. Even if it were buried in the earth, or thrown into the sea, the
	dawn of the next morning would behold it in the pockets of Pietro. Few
	people, in consequence, liked to have dealings with such a personage,
	especially for gold. Some, bolder than the rest, thought that his power
	did not extend over silver; but, when they made the experiment, they found
	themselves mistaken. Bolts and bars could not restrain it, and it
	sometimes became invisible in their very hands, and was whisked through
	the air to the purse of the magician. He necessarily acquired a very bad
	character; and, having given utterance to some sentiments regarding
	religion which were the very reverse of orthodox, he was summoned before
	the tribunals of the Inquisition to answer for his crimes as a heretic and
	a sorcerer. He loudly protested his innocence, even upon the rack, where
	he suffered more torture than nature could support. He died in prison ere
	his trial was concluded, but was afterwards found guilty. His bones were
	ordered to be dug up and publicly burned. He was also burned in effigy in
	the streets of Padua.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Raymond Lulli.</h3>

		<p class="caption">RAYMOND LULLI.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>While Arnold de Villeneuve and Pietro d’Apone flourished in France and
	Italy, a more celebrated adept than either appeared in Spain. This was
	Raymond Lulli, a name which stands in the first rank among the alchymists.
	Unlike many of his predecessors, he made no pretensions to astrology or
	necromancy; but, taking Geber for his model, studied intently the nature
	and composition of metals, without reference to charms, incantations, or
	any foolish ceremonies. It was not, however, till late in life that he
	commenced his study of the art. His early and middle age were spent in a
	different manner, and his whole history is romantic in the extreme. He was
	born of an illustrious family, in Majorca, in the year 1235. When that
	island was taken from the Saracens by James I. king of Aragon, in 1230,
	the father of Raymond, who was originally of Catalonia, settled there, and
	received a considerable appointment from the crown. Raymond married at an
	early age; and, being fond of pleasure, he left the solitudes of his
	native isle, and passed over with his bride into Spain. He was made Grand
	Seneschal at the court of King James, and led <a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"></a>a gay life for several
	years. Faithless to his wife, he was always in the pursuit of some new
	beauty, till his heart was fixed at last by the lovely but unkind Ambrosia
	de Castello. This lady, like her admirer, was married; but, unlike him,
	was faithful to her vows, and treated all his solicitations with disdain.
	Raymond was so enamoured, that repulse only increased his flame; he
	lingered all night under her windows, wrote passionate verses in her
	praise, neglected his affairs, and made himself the butt of all the
	courtiers. One day, while watching under her lattice, he by chance caught
	sight of her bosom, as her neckerchief was blown aside by the wind. The
	fit of inspiration came over him, and he sat down and composed some tender
	stanzas upon the subject, and sent them to the lady. The fair Ambrosia had
	never before condescended to answer his letters; but she replied to this.
	She told him that she could never listen to his suit; that it was
	unbecoming in a wise man to fix his thoughts, as he had done, on any other
	than his God; and entreated him to devote himself to a religious life, and
	conquer the unworthy passion which he had suffered to consume him. She,
	however, offered, if he wished it, to shew him the <em>fair</em> bosom which had
	so captivated him. Raymond was delighted. He thought the latter part of
	this epistle but ill corresponded with the former, and that Ambrosia, in
	spite of the good advice she gave him, had at last relented, and would
	make him as happy as he desired. He followed her about from place to
	place, entreating her to fulfil her promise: but still Ambrosia was cold,
	and implored him with tears to importune her no longer; for that she never
	could be his, and never would, if she were free to-morrow. “What means
	your letter, then?” said the despairing lover. “I will shew you!” replied
	Ambrosia, who immediately uncovered her bosom, and exposed to the eyes of
	her horror-stricken admirer a large cancer which had extended to both
	breasts. She saw that he was shocked; and, extending her hand to him, she
	prayed him once more to lead a religious life, and set his heart upon the
	Creator, and not upon the creature. He went home an altered man. He threw
	up, on the morrow, his valuable <a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"></a>appointment at the court, separated from
	his wife, and took a farewell of his children, after dividing one-half of
	his ample fortune among them. The other half he shared among the poor. He
	then threw himself at the foot of a crucifix, and devoted himself to the
	service of God, vowing, as the most acceptable atonement for his errors,
	that he would employ the remainder of his days in the task of converting
	the Mussulmans to the Christian religion. In his dreams he saw Jesus
	Christ, who said to him, “Raymond! Raymond! follow me!” The vision was
	three times repeated, and Raymond was convinced that it was an intimation
	direct from heaven. Having put his affairs in order, he set out on a
	pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James of Compostello, and afterwards lived
	for ten years in solitude amid the mountains of Aranda. Here he learned
	the Arabic, to qualify himself for his mission of converting the
	Mahometans. He also studied various sciences, as taught in the works of
	the learned men of the East, and first made acquaintance with the writings
	of Geber, which were destined to exercise so much influence over his
	future life.</p>

	<p>At the end of this probation, and when he had entered his fortieth year,
	he emerged from his solitude into more active life. With some remains of
	his fortune, which had accumulated during his retirement, he founded a
	college for the study of Arabic, which was approved of by the pope, with
	many commendations upon his zeal and piety. At this time he narrowly
	escaped assassination from an Arabian youth whom he had taken into his
	service. Raymond had prayed to God, in some of his accesses of fanaticism,
	that he might suffer martyrdom in his holy cause. His servant had
	overheard him: and, being as great a fanatic as his master, he resolved to
	gratify his wish, and punish him, at the same time, for the curses which
	he incessantly launched against Mahomet and all who believed in him, by
	stabbing him to the heart. He therefore aimed a blow at his master as he
	sat one day at table; but the instinct of self-preservation being stronger
	than the desire of martyrdom, Raymond grappled with his antagonist, and
	overthrew him. He scorned to take his life himself; but handed him over to
	the authorities of the town, by whom he was afterwards found dead in his
	prison.</p>

	<p>After this adventure Raymond travelled to Paris, where he resided for some
	time, and made the acquaintance of Arnold de Villeneuve. From him he
	probably received some encouragement to search for the philosopher’s
	stone, as he began from that time forth to devote less of his attention to
	religious matters, and more to the study of alchymy. Still he never lost
	sight of the great object for which he lived—the conversion of the
	Mahometans—and proceeded to Rome, <a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"></a>to communicate personally with Pope
	John XXI. on the best measures to be adopted for that end. The Pope gave
	him encouragement in words, but failed to associate any other persons with
	him in the enterprise which he meditated. Raymond, therefore, set out for
	Tunis alone, and was kindly received by many Arabian philosophers, who had
	heard of his fame as a professor of alchymy. If he had stuck to alchymy
	while in their country, it would have been well for him; but he began
	cursing Mahomet, and got himself into trouble. While preaching the
	doctrines of Christianity in the great bazaar of Tunis, he was arrested
	and thrown into prison. He was shortly afterwards brought to trial, and
	sentenced to death. Some of his philosophic friends interceded hard for
	him, and he was pardoned upon condition that he left Africa immediately
	and never again set foot in it. If he was found there again, no matter
	what his object might be, or whatever length of time might intervene, his
	original sentence would be carried into execution. Raymond was not at all
	solicitous of martyrdom when it came to the point, whatever he might have
	been when there was no danger, and he gladly accepted his life upon these
	conditions, and left Tunis with the intention of proceeding to Rome. He
	afterwards changed his plan, and established himself at Milan, where, for
	a length of time, he practised alchymy, and some say astrology, with great
	success.</p>

	<p>Most writers who believed in the secrets of alchymy, and who have noticed
	the life of Raymond Lulli, assert, that while in Milan, he received
	letters from Edward King of England, inviting him to settle in his states.
	They add that Lulli gladly accepted the invitation, and had apartments
	assigned for his use in the Tower of London, where he refined much gold;
	superintended the coinage of “rose-nobles,” and made gold out of iron,
	quicksilver, lead, and pewter, to the amount of six millions. The writers
	in the <cite>Biographie Universelle</cite>, an excellent authority in general, deny
	that Raymond was ever in England, and say, that in all these stories of
	his wondrous powers as an alchymist, he has been mistaken for another
	Raymond, a Jew of Tarragona. Naudé, in his <cite>Apologie</cite>, says, simply, “that
	six millions were given by Raymond Lulli to King Edward, to make war
	against the Turks and other infidels:” not that he transmuted so much
	metal into gold; but, as he afterwards adds, that he advised Edward to lay
	a tax upon wool, which produced that amount. To shew that Raymond went to
	England, his admirers quote a work attributed to him, <cite>De Transmutatione
	Animæ Metallorum</cite>, in which he expressly says that he was in England at
	the intercession of the king.<a href="#fn34" id="fnm34" title="Vidimus omnia..." class="fnmarker">34</a> The hermetic <a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"></a>writers are not agreed
	whether it was Edward I. or Edward II. who invited him over; but, by
	fixing the date of his journey in 1312, they make it appear that it was
	Edward II. Edmond Dickenson, in his work on the <cite>Quintessences of the
	Philosophers</cite>, says, that Raymond worked in Westminster Abbey, where, a
	long time after his departure, there was found in the cell which he had
	occupied a great quantity of golden dust, of which the architects made a
	great profit. In the biographical sketch of John Cremer, Abbot of
	Westminster, given by Lenglet, it is said that it was chiefly through his
	instrumentality that Raymond came to England. Cremer had been himself for
	thirty years occupied in the vain search for the philosopher’s stone, when
	he accidentally met Raymond in Italy, and endeavoured to induce him to
	communicate his grand secret. Raymond told him that he must find it for
	himself, as all great alchymists had done before him. Cremer, on his
	return to England, spoke to King Edward in high terms of the wonderful
	attainments of the philosopher, and a letter of invitation was forthwith
	sent him. Robert Constantinus, in the <cite>Nomenclator Scriptorum Medicorum</cite>,
	published in 1515, says, that after a great deal of research, he found
	that Raymond Lulli resided for some time in London, and that he actually
	made gold, by means of the philosopher’s stone, in the Tower; that he had
	seen the golden pieces of his coinage, which were still named in England
	the nobles of Raymond, or rose-nobles. Lulli himself appears to have
	boasted that he made gold; for, in his well-known <cite>Testamentum</cite>, he states
	that he converted no less than fifty thousand pounds weight of
	quicksilver, lead, and pewter into that metal.<a href="#fn35" id="fnm35" title="Converti una..." class="fnmarker">35</a> It seems highly
	probable that the English king, believing in the extraordinary powers of
	the alchymist, invited him to England to make test of them, and that he
	was employed in refining gold and in coining. Camden, who is not credulous
	in matters like these, affords his countenance to the story of his coinage
	of nobles; and there is nothing at all wonderful in the fact of a man
	famous for his knowledge of metals being employed in such a capacity.
	Raymond was, at this time, an old man, in his seventy-seventh year, and
	somewhat in his dotage. He was willing enough to have it believed that he
	had discovered the grand secret, and supported the rumour rather than
	contradicted it. He did not long remain in England, but returned to Rome
	to carry out the projects which were nearer to his heart than the
	profession of alchymy. He had proposed them to several successive popes
	with little or no success. The first was a plan for the introduction of
	the oriental languages into all the monasteries of Europe; the second, for
	the <a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"></a>reduction into one of all the military orders, that, being united,
	they might move more efficaciously against the Saracens; and the third,
	that the sovereign pontiff should forbid the works of Averroes to be read
	in the schools, as being more favourable to Mahometanism than to
	Christianity. The pope did not receive the old man with much cordiality;
	and, after remaining for about two years in Rome, he proceeded once more
	to Africa, alone and unprotected, to preach the Gospel of Jesus. He landed
	at Bona in 1314, and so irritated the Mahometans by cursing their prophet,
	that they stoned him, and left him for dead on the sea-shore. He was found
	some hours afterwards by a party of Genoese merchants, who conveyed him on
	board their vessel, and sailed towards Majorca. The unfortunate man still
	breathed, but could not articulate. He lingered in this state for some
	days, and expired just as the vessel arrived within sight of his native
	shores. His body was conveyed with great pomp to the church of St.
	Eulalia, at Palma, where a public funeral was instituted in his honour.
	Miracles were afterwards said to have been worked at his tomb.</p>

	<p>Thus ended the career of Raymond Lulli, one of the most extraordinary men
	of his age; and, with the exception of his last boast about the six
	millions of gold, the least inclined to quackery of any of the professors
	of alchymy. His writings were very numerous, and include nearly five
	hundred volumes, upon grammar, rhetoric, morals, theology, politics, civil
	and canon law, physics, metaphysics, astronomy, medicine, and chemistry.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Roger Bacon.</h3>

	<p>The powerful delusion of alchymy seized upon a mind still greater than
	that of Raymond Lulli. Roger Bacon firmly believed in the philosopher’s
	stone, and spent much of his time in search of it. His example helped to
	render all the learned men of the time more convinced of its
	practicability, and more eager in the pursuit. He was born at Ilchester,
	in the county of Somerset, in the year 1214. He studied for some time in
	the University of Oxford, and afterwards in that of Paris, in which he
	received the degree of doctor of divinity. Returning to England in 1240,
	he became a monk of the order of St. Francis. He was by far the most
	learned man of his age; and his acquirements were so much above the
	comprehension of his contemporaries, that they could only account for them
	by supposing that he was indebted for them to the devil. Voltaire has not
	inaptly designated him “De l’or encrouté de toutes les ordures de son
	siècle;” but the crust of superstition that enveloped his powerful mind,
	though it may have dimmed, could not obscure the brightness of his genius.
	To him, and apparently to him only, among all the inquiring spirits of the
	time, were known the properties <a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"></a>of the concave and convex lens. He also
	invented the magic lantern; that pretty plaything of modern days, which
	acquired for him a reputation that embittered his life. In a history of
	alchymy, the name of this great man cannot be omitted, although unlike
	many others of whom we shall have occasion to speak, he only made it
	secondary to other pursuits. The love of universal knowledge that filled
	his mind, would not allow him to neglect one branch of science, of which
	neither he nor the world could yet see the absurdity. He made ample amends
	for his time lost in this pursuit by his knowledge in physics and his
	acquaintance with astronomy. The telescope, burning-glasses, and
	gunpowder, are discoveries which may well carry his fame to the remotest
	time, and make the world blind to the one spot of folly—the diagnosis of
	the age in which he lived, and the circumstances by which he was
	surrounded. His treatise on the <cite>Admirable Power of Art and Nature in the
	Production of the Philosopher’s Stone</cite> was translated into French by
	Girard de Tormes, and published at Lyons in 1557. His <cite>Mirror of Alchymy</cite>
	was also published in French in the same year, and in Paris in 1612, with
	some additions from the works of Raymond Lulli. A complete list of all the
	published treatises upon the subject may be seen in Lenglet du Fresnoy.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Pope John XXII.</h3>

	<p>This prelate is said to have been the friend and pupil of Arnold de
	Villeneuve, by whom he was instructed in all the secrets of alchymy.
	Tradition asserts of him, that he made great quantities of gold, and died
	as rich as Crœsus. He was born at Cahors, in the province of Guienne, in
	the year 1244. He was a very eloquent preacher, and soon reached high
	dignity in the Church. He wrote a work on the transmutation of metals, and
	had a famous laboratory at Avignon. He issued two bulls against the
	numerous pretenders to the art, who had sprung up in every part of
	Christendom; from which it might be inferred that he was himself free from
	the delusion. The alchymists claim him, however, as one of the most
	distinguished and successful professors of their art, and say that his
	bulls were not directed against the real adepts, but the false pretenders.
	They lay particular stress upon these words in his bull, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spondent, quas
	non exhibent, divitias, <em>pauperes</em> alchymistæ.</span>” These, it is clear, they
	say, relate only to <em>poor</em> alchymists, and therefore false ones. He died
	in the year 1344, leaving in his coffers a sum of eighteen millions of
	florins. Popular belief alleged that he had made, and not amassed, this
	treasure; and alchymists complacently cite this as a proof that the
	philosopher’s stone was not such a chimera as the incredulous pretended.
	They <a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"></a>take it for granted that John really left this money, and ask by what
	possible means he could have accumulated it. Replying to their own
	question, they say triumphantly, “His book shews it was by alchymy, the
	secrets of which he learned from Arnold de Villeneuve and Raymond Lulli.
	But he was as prudent as all other hermetic philosophers. Whoever would
	read his book to find out his secret, would employ all his labour in vain;
	the pope took good care not to divulge it.” Unluckily for their own
	credit, all these gold-makers are in the same predicament; their great
	secret loses its worth most wonderfully in the telling, and therefore they
	keep it snugly to themselves. Perhaps they thought that, if everybody
	could transmute metals, gold would be so plentiful that it would be no
	longer valuable, and that some new art would be requisite to transmute it
	back again into steel and iron. If so, society is much indebted to them
	for their forbearance.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Jean de Meung.</h3>

	<p>All classes of men dabbled in the art at this time; the last mentioned was
	a pope, the one of whom we now speak was a poet. Jean de Meung, the
	celebrated author of the <cite>Roman de la Rose</cite>, was born in the year 1279 or
	1280, and was a great personage at the courts of Louis X., Philip the
	Long, Charles IV., and Philip de Valois. His famous poem of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roman de
	la Rose</cite>, which treats of every subject in vogue at that day, necessarily
	makes great mention of alchymy. Jean was a firm believer in the art, and
	wrote, besides his Roman, two shorter poems, the one entitled <cite>The
	Remonstrance of Nature to the wandering Alchymist</cite> and <cite>The Reply of the
	Alchymist to Nature</cite>. Poetry and alchymy were his delight, and priests and
	women were his abomination. A pleasant story is related of him and the
	ladies of the court of Charles IV. He had written the following libellous
	couplet upon the fair sex:</p>
	
	<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p>“Toutes êtes, serez, ou fûtes,</p>
		<p>De fait ou de volonté, putains;</p>
		<p>Et qui très bien vous chercherait,</p>
		<p>Toutes putains vous trouverait.”<a href="#fn36" id="fnm36" title="These verses..." class="fnmarker">36</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>This naturally gave great offence; and being perceived one day in the
	king’s antechamber, by some ladies who were waiting for an audience, they
	resolved to punish him. To the number of ten or twelve, they armed
	themselves with canes and rods, and surrounding the unlucky poet, called
	upon the gentlemen present to strip him naked, that they might wreak just
	vengeance upon him, and lash him through the <a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"></a>streets of the town. Some of
	the lords present were in no wise loath, and promised themselves great
	sport from his punishment. But Jean de Meung was unmoved by their threats,
	and stood up calmly in the midst of them, begging them to hear him first,
	and then, if not satisfied, they might do as they liked with him. Silence
	being restored, he stood upon a chair, and entered on his defence. He
	acknowledged that he was the author of the obnoxious verses, but denied
	that they bore reference to all womankind. He only meant to speak of the
	vicious and abandoned, whereas those whom he saw around him were patterns
	of virtue, loveliness, and modesty. If, however, any lady present thought
	herself aggrieved, he would consent to be stripped, and she might lash him
	till her arms were wearied. It is added, that by this means Jean escaped
	his flogging, and that the wrath of the fair ones immediately subsided.
	The gentlemen present were, however, of opinion, that if every lady in the
	room whose character corresponded with the verses had taken him at his
	word; the poet would in all probability have been beaten to death. All his
	life long he evinced a great animosity towards the priesthood, and his
	famous poem abounds with passages reflecting upon their avarice, cruelty,
	and immorality. At his death he left a large box, filled with some weighty
	material, which he bequeathed to the Cordeliers, as a peace-offering, for
	the abuse he had lavished upon them. As his practice of alchymy was well
	known, it was thought the box was filled with gold and silver, and the
	Cordeliers congratulated each other on their rich acquisition. When it
	came to be opened, they found to their horror that it was filled only with
	<em>slates</em>, scratched with hieroglyphic and cabalistic characters. Indignant
	at the insult, they determined to refuse him Christian burial, on pretence
	that he was a sorcerer. He was, however, honourably buried in Paris, the
	whole court attending his funeral.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Nicholas Flamel.</h3>

	<p>The story of this alchymist, as handed down by tradition, and enshrined in
	the pages of Lenglet da Fresnoy, is not a little marvellous. He was born
	at Pontoise, of a poor but respectable family, at the end of the
	thirteenth, or beginning of the fourteenth century. Having no patrimony,
	he set out for Paris at an early age, to try his fortune as a public
	scribe. He had received a good education, was well skilled in the learned
	languages, and was an excellent penman. He soon procured occupation as a
	letter-writer and copyist, and used to sit at the corner of the Rue de
	Marivaux, and practise his calling; but he hardly made profit enough to
	keep body and soul together. To mend his fortunes he tried poetry; but
	this was a more wretched occupation still. As a transcriber he had at
	least gained bread and <a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"></a>cheese; but his rhymes were not worth a crust. He
	then tried painting with as little success; and as a last resource, began
	to search for the philosopher’s stone and tell fortunes. This was a
	happier idea; he soon increased in substance, and had wherewithal to live
	comfortably. He therefore took unto himself his wife Petronella, and began
	to save money; but continued to all outward appearance as poor and
	miserable as before. In the course of a few years, he became desperately
	addicted to the study of alchymy, and thought of nothing but the
	philosopher’s stone, the elixir of life, and the universal alkahest. In
	the year 1257, he bought by chance an old book for two florins, which soon
	became his sole study. It was written with a steel instrument upon the
	bark of trees, and contained twenty-one, or as he himself always expressed
	it, three times seven, leaves. The writing was very elegant and in the
	Latin language. Each seventh leaf contained a picture and no writing. On
	the first of these was a serpent swallowing rods; on the second, a cross
	with a serpent crucified; and on the third, the representation of a
	desert, in the midst of which was a fountain, with serpents crawling from
	side to side. It purported to be written by no less a personage than
	“Abraham, patriarch, Jew, prince, philosopher, priest, Levite, and
	astrologer;” and invoked curses upon any one who should cast eyes upon it,
	without being “a sacrificer or a scribe.” Nicholas Flamel never thought it
	extraordinary that Abraham should have known Latin, and was convinced that
	the characters on his book had been traced by the hands of that great
	patriarch himself. He was at first afraid to read it, after he became
	aware of the curse it contained; but he got over that difficulty by
	recollecting that, although he was not a sacrificer, he had practised as a
	scribe. As he read he was filled with admiration, and found that it was a
	perfect treatise upon the transmutation of metals. All the processes were
	clearly explained; the vessels, the retorts, the mixtures, and the proper
	times and seasons for experiment. But as ill-luck would have it, the
	possession of the philosopher’s stone, or prime agent in the work, was
	presupposed. This was a difficulty which was not to be got over. It was
	like telling a starving man how to cook a beef-steak, instead of giving
	him the money to buy one. But Nicholas did not despair, and set about
	studying the hieroglyphics and allegorical representations with which the
	book abounded. He soon convinced himself that it had been one of the
	sacred books of the Jews, and that it was taken from the temple of
	Jerusalem on its destruction by Titus. The process of reasoning by which
	he arrived at this conclusion is not stated.</p>

	<p>From some expression in the treatise, he learned that the allegorical
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"></a>drawings on the fourth and fifth leaves enshrined the secret of the
	philosopher’s stone, without which all the fine Latin of the directions
	was utterly unavailing. He invited all the alchymists and learned men of
	Paris to come and examine them, but they all departed as wise as they
	came. Nobody could make any thing either of Nicholas or his pictures; and
	some even went so far as to say that his invaluable book was not worth a
	farthing. This was not to be borne; and Nicholas resolved to discover the
	great secret by himself, without troubling the philosophers. He found on
	the first page of the fourth leaf, the picture of Mercury attacked by an
	old man resembling Saturn or Time. The latter had an hour-glass on his
	head, and in his hand a scythe, with which he aimed a blow at Mercury’s
	feet. The reverse of the leaf represented a flower growing on a mountain
	top, shaken rudely by the wind, with a blue stalk, red and white blossoms,
	and leaves of pure gold. Around it were a great number of dragons and
	griffins. On the first page of the fifth leaf was a fine garden, in the
	midst of which was a rose-tree in full bloom, supported against the trunk
	of a gigantic oak. At the foot of this there bubbled up a fountain of
	milk-white water, which, forming a small stream, flowed through the
	garden, and was afterwards lost in the sands. On the second page was a
	king, with a sword in his hand, superintending a number of soldiers, who,
	in execution of his orders, were killing a great multitude of young
	children, spurning the prayers and tears of their mothers, who tried to
	save them from destruction. The blood of the children was carefully
	collected by another party of soldiers, and put into a large vessel, in
	which two allegorical figures of the sun and moon were bathing themselves.</p>

	<p>For twenty-one years poor Nicholas wearied himself with the study of these
	pictures, but still he could make nothing of them. His wife Petronella at
	last persuaded him to find out some learned rabbi; but there was no rabbi
	in Paris learned enough to be of any service to him. The Jews met but
	small encouragement to fix their abode in France, and all the chiefs of
	that people were located in Spain. To Spain accordingly Nicholas Flamel
	repaired. He left his book in Paris, for fear, perhaps, that he might be
	robbed of it on the road; and telling his neighbours that he was going on
	a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James of Compostello, he trudged on foot
	towards Madrid in search of a rabbi. He was absent two years in that
	country, and made himself known to a great number of Jews, descendants of
	those who had been expelled from France in the reign of Philip Augustus.
	The believers in the philosopher’s stone give the following account of his
	adventures: They say that at Leon he made the acquaintance of a converted
	Jew, named Cauches, a very learned physician, <a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"></a>to whom he explained the
	title and nature of his little book. The doctor was transported with joy
	as soon as he heard it named, and immediately resolved to accompany
	Nicholas to Paris, that he might have a sight of it. The two set out
	together; the doctor on the way entertaining his companion with the
	history of his book, which, if the genuine book he thought it to be, from
	the description he had heard of it, was in the handwriting of Abraham
	himself, and had been in the possession of personages no less
	distinguished than Moses, Joshua, Solomon, and Esdras. It contained all
	the secrets of alchymy and of many other sciences, and was the most
	valuable book that had ever existed in this world. The doctor was himself
	no mean adept, and Nicholas profited greatly by his discourse, as in the
	garb of poor pilgrims they wended their way to Paris, convinced of their
	power to turn every old shovel in that capital into pure gold. But,
	unfortunately, when they reached Orleans, the doctor was taken dangerously
	ill. Nicholas watched by his bedside, and acted the double part of a
	physician and nurse to him; but he died after a few days, lamenting with
	his last breath that he had not lived long enough to see the precious
	volume. Nicholas rendered the last honours to his body; and with a
	sorrowful heart, and not one <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sou</em> in his pocket, proceeded home to his
	wife Petronella. He immediately recommenced the study of his pictures; but
	for two whole years he was as far from understanding them as ever. At
	last, in the third year, a glimmer of light stole over his understanding.
	He recalled some expression of his friend the doctor, which had hitherto
	escaped his memory, and he found that all his previous experiments had
	been conducted on a wrong basis. He recommenced them now with renewed
	energy, and at the end of the year had the satisfaction to see all his
	toils rewarded. On the 13th January 1382, says Lenglet, he made a
	projection on mercury, and had some very excellent silver. On the 25th
	April following, he converted a large quantity of mercury into gold, and
	the great secret was his.</p>

	<p>Nicholas was now about eighty years of age, and still a hale and stout old
	man. His friends say that by a simultaneous discovery of the elixir of
	life, he found means to keep death at a distance for another quarter of a
	century; and that he died in 1415, at the age of 116. In this interval he
	made immense quantities of gold, though to all outward appearance he was
	as poor as a mouse. At an early period of his changed fortune, he had,
	like a worthy man, taken counsel with his old wife Petronella, as to the
	best use he could make of his wealth. Petronella replied, that as
	unfortunately they had no children, the best thing he could do, was to
	build hospitals and endow churches. Nicholas thought so too, especially
	when he began to find <a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"></a>that his elixir could not keep off death, and that
	the grim foe was making rapid advances upon him. He richly endowed the
	church of St. Jacques de la Boucherie, near the Rue de Marivaux, where he
	had all his life resided, besides seven others in different parts of the
	kingdom. He also endowed fourteen hospitals, and built three chapels.</p>

	<p>The fame of his great wealth and his munificent benefactions soon spread
	over all the country, and he was visited, among others, by the celebrated
	doctors of that day, Jean Gerson, Jean de Courtecuisse, and Pierre
	d’Ailli. They found him in his humble apartment, meanly clad, and eating
	porridge out of an earthen vessel; and with regard to his secret, as
	impenetrable as all his predecessors in alchymy. His fame reached the ears
	of the king, Charles VI., who sent M. de Cramoisi, the Master of Requests,
	to find out whether Nicholas had indeed discovered the philosopher’s
	stone. But M. de Cramoisi took nothing by his visit; all his attempts to
	sound the alchymist were unavailing, and he returned to his royal master
	no wiser than he came. It was in this year, 1414, that he lost his
	faithful Petronella. He did not long survive her, but died in the
	following year, and was buried with great pomp by the grateful priests of
	St. Jacques de la Boucherie.</p>

	<p>The great wealth of Nicholas Flamel is undoubted, as the records of
	several churches and hospitals in France can testify. That he practised
	alchymy is equally certain, as he left behind several works upon the
	subject. Those who knew him well, and who were incredulous about the
	philosopher’s stone, give a satisfactory solution of the secret of his
	wealth. They say that he was always a miser and a usurer; that his journey
	to Spain was undertaken with very different motives from those pretended
	by the alchymists; that, in fact, he went to collect debts due from Jews
	in that country to their brethren in Paris, and that he charged a
	commission of fully cent per cent in consideration of the difficulty of
	collecting and the dangers of the road; that when he possessed thousands,
	he lived upon almost nothing; and was the general money-lender, at
	enormous profits, to all the dissipated young men at the French court.</p>

	<p>Among the works written by Nicholas Flamel on the subject of alchymy is
	<cite>The Philosophic Summary</cite>, a poem, reprinted in 1735, as an appendix to
	the third volume of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roman de la Rose</cite>. He also wrote three treatises
	upon natural philosophy, and an alchymic allegory, entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Désir
	désiré</cite>. Specimens of his writing, and a fac-simile of the drawings in his
	book of Abraham, may be seen in Salmon’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque des Philosophes
	Chimiques</cite>. The writer of the article <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flamel</cite> in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie
	Universelle</cite> says, that for a hundred years after the death of Flamel,
	many of the adepts believed that he was still alive, and that he would
	live for upwards of six hundred years. The house he formerly <a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"></a>occupied, at
	the corner of the Rue de Marivaux, has been often taken by credulous
	speculators, and ransacked from top to bottom, in the hopes that gold
	might be found. A report was current in Paris, not long previous to the
	year 1816, that some lodgers had found in the cellars several jars filled
	with a dark-coloured ponderous matter. Upon the strength of the rumour, a
	believer in all the wondrous tales told of Nicholas Flamel bought the
	house, and nearly pulled it to pieces in ransacking the walls and
	wainscoting for hidden gold. He got nothing for his pains, however, and
	had a heavy bill to pay to restore his dilapidations.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">George Ripley.</h3>

	<p>While alchymy was thus cultivated on the continent of Europe, it was not
	neglected in the isles of Britain. Since the time of Roger Bacon, it had
	fascinated the imagination of many ardent men in England. In the year 1404
	an act of parliament was passed declaring the making of gold and silver to
	be felony. Great alarm was felt at that time lest any alchymist should
	succeed in his projects, and perhaps bring ruin upon the state by
	furnishing boundless wealth to some designing tyrant, who would make use
	of it to enslave his country. This alarm appears to have soon subsided;
	for, in the year 1455, King Henry VI., by advice of his council and
	parliament, granted four successive patents and commissions to several
	knights, citizens of London, chemists, monks, mass-priests, and others, to
	find out the philosopher’s stone and elixir, “to the great benefit,” said
	the patent, “of the realm, and the enabling of the king to pay all the
	debts of the crown in real gold and silver.” Prinn, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aurum Reginæ</cite>,
	observes, as a note to this passage, that the king’s reason for granting
	this patent to ecclesiastics was, that “they were such good artists in
	transubstantiating bread and wine in the eucharist, and therefore the more
	likely to be able to effect the transmutation of baser metals into
	better.” No gold, of course, was ever made; and next year the king,
	doubting very much of the practicability of the thing, took further
	advice, and appointed a commission of ten learned men and persons of
	eminence to judge and certify to him whether the transmutation of metals
	were a thing practicable or no. It does not appear whether the commission
	ever made any report upon the subject.</p>

	<p>In the succeeding reign an alchymist appeared who pretended to have
	discovered the secret. This was George Ripley, the canon of Bridlington,
	in Yorkshire. He studied for twenty years in the universities of Italy,
	and was a great favourite with Pope Innocent VIII., who made him one of
	his domestic chaplains, and master of the ceremonies in his household.
	Returning to England in 1477, he dedicated <a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"></a>to King Edward IV. his famous
	work, <cite>The Compound of Alchymy</cite>; or, <cite>the Twelve Gates leading to the
	Discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone</cite>. These gates he described to be
	calcination, solution, separation, conjunction, putrefaction, congelation,
	cibation, sublimation, fermentation, exaltation, multiplication, and
	projection; to which he might have added botheration, the most important
	process of all. He was very rich, and allowed it to be believed that he
	could make gold out of iron. Fuller, in his <cite>Worthies of England</cite>, says
	that an English gentleman of good credit reported, that in his travels
	abroad he saw a record in the island of Malta which declared that Ripley
	gave yearly to the knights of that island, and of Rhodes, the enormous sum
	of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to enable them to carry on the war
	against the Turks. In his old age he became an anchorite near Boston, and
	wrote twenty-five volumes upon the subject of alchymy, the most important
	of which is the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duodecim Portarum</cite> already mentioned. Before he died, he
	seems to have acknowledged that he had mis-spent his life in this vain
	study, and requested that all men, when they met with any of his books,
	would burn them, or afford them no credit, as they had been written merely
	from his opinion, and not from proof; and that subsequent trial had made
	manifest to him that they were false and vain.<a href="#fn37" id="fnm37" title="Fuller's..." class="fnmarker">37</a></p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Basil Valentine.</h3>

	<p>Germany also produced many famous alchymists in the fifteenth century, the
	chief of whom are Basil Valentine, Bernard of Trèves, and the Abbot
	Trithemius. Basil Valentine was born at Mayence, and was made prior of St.
	Peter’s, at Erfurt, about the year 1414. It was known, during his life,
	that he diligently sought the philosopher’s stone, and that he had written
	some works upon the process of transmutation. They were thought for many
	years to be lost, but were, after his death, discovered enclosed in the
	stone-work of one of the pillars in the Abbey. They were twenty-one in
	number, and are fully set forth in the third volume of Lenglet’s <cite>History
	of the Hermetic Philosophy</cite>. The alchymists asserted that heaven itself
	conspired to bring to light these extraordinary works; and that the pillar
	in which they were enclosed was miraculously shattered by a thunderbolt;
	and that as soon as the manuscripts were liberated, the pillar closed up
	again of its own accord!</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Bernard of Treves.</h3>

	<p>The life of this philosopher is a remarkable instance of talent and
	perseverance misapplied. In the search of his chimera nothing could <a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"></a>daunt
	him. Repeated disappointment never diminished his hopes; and from the age
	of fourteen to that of eighty-five he was incessantly employed among the
	drugs and furnaces of his laboratory, wasting his life with the view of
	prolonging it, and reducing himself to beggary in the hopes of growing
	rich.</p>

	<p>He was born at either Trèves or Padua in the year 1406. His father is said
	by some to have been a physician in the latter city, and by others to have
	been Count of the Marches of Trèves, and one of the most wealthy nobles of
	his country. At all events, whether noble or physician, he was a rich man,
	and left his son a magnificent estate. At the age of fourteen he first
	became enamoured of the science of alchymy, and read the Arabian authors
	in their own language. He himself has left a most interesting record of
	his labours and wanderings, from which the following particulars are
	chiefly extracted. The first book which fell into his hands was that of
	the Arabian philosopher Rhazes, from the reading of which he imagined that
	he had discovered the means of augmenting gold a hundredfold. For four
	years he worked in his laboratory, with the book of Rhazes continually
	before him. At the end of that time, he found that he had spent no less
	than eight hundred crowns upon his experiment, and had got nothing but
	fire and smoke for his pains. He now began to lose confidence in Rhazes,
	and turned to the works of Geber. He studied him assiduously for two
	years; and being young, rich, and credulous, was beset by all the
	alchymists of the town, who kindly assisted him in spending his money. He
	did not lose his faith in Geber, or patience with his hungry assistants,
	until he had lost two thousand crowns—a very considerable sum in those
	days.</p>

	<p>Among all the crowd of pretended men of science who surrounded him, there
	was but one as enthusiastic and as disinterested as himself. With this
	man, who was a monk of the order of St. Francis, he contracted an intimate
	friendship, and spent nearly all his time. Some obscure treatises of
	Rupecissa and Sacrobosco having fallen into their hands, they were
	persuaded, from reading them, that highly rectified spirits of wine was
	the universal alkahest, or dissolvent, which would aid them greatly in the
	process of transmutation. They rectified the alcohol thirty times, till
	they made it so strong as to burst the vessels which contained it. After
	they had worked three years, and spent three hundred crowns in the liquor,
	they discovered that they were on the wrong track. They next tried alum
	and copperas; but the great secret still escaped them. They afterwards
	imagined that there was a marvellous virtue in all excrement, especially
	the human, and actually employed more than two years in experimentalising
	upon it with mercury, salt, and molten lead! Again the adepts flocked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"></a>around him from far and near to aid him with their counsels. He received
	them all hospitably, and divided his wealth among them so generously and
	unhesitatingly, that they gave him the name of the “Good Trevisan,” by
	which he is still often mentioned in works that treat on alchymy. For
	twelve years he led this life, making experiments every day upon some new
	substance, and praying to God night and morning that he might discover the
	secret of transmutation.</p>

	<p>In this interval he lost his friend the monk, and was joined by a
	magistrate of the city of Trèves, as ardent as himself in the search. His
	new acquaintance imagined that the ocean was the mother of gold, and that
	sea-salt would change lead or iron into the precious metals. Bernard
	resolved to try; and, transporting his laboratory to a house on the shores
	of the Baltic, he worked upon salt for more than a year, melting it,
	sublimating it, crystallising it, and occasionally drinking it, for the
	sake of other experiments. Still the strange enthusiast was not wholly
	discouraged, and his failure in one trial only made him the more anxious
	to attempt another.</p>

	<p>He was now approaching the age of fifty, and had as yet seen nothing of
	the world. He therefore determined to travel through Germany, Italy,
	France, and Spain. Wherever he stopped he made inquiries whether there
	were any alchymists in the neighbourhood. He invariably sought them out;
	and if they were poor, relieved, and if affluent, encouraged them. At
	Citeaux he became acquainted with one Geoffrey Leuvier, a monk of that
	place, who persuaded him that the essence of egg-shells was a valuable
	ingredient. He tried, therefore, what could be done; and was only
	prevented from wasting a year or two on the experiment by the opinions of
	an attorney, at Berghem, in Flanders, who said that the great secret
	resided in vinegar and copperas. He was not convinced of the absurdity of
	this idea until he had nearly poisoned himself. He resided in France for
	about five years, when, hearing accidentally that one Master Henry,
	confessor to the Emperor Frederic III., had discovered the philosopher’s
	stone, he set out for Germany to pay him a visit. He had, as usual,
	surrounded himself with a set of hungry dependants, several of whom
	determined to accompany him. He had not heart to refuse them, and he
	arrived at Vienna with five of them. Bernard sent a polite invitation to
	the confessor, and gave him a sumptuous entertainment, at which were
	present nearly all the alchymists of Vienna. Master Henry frankly
	confessed that he had not discovered the philosopher’s stone, but that he
	had all his life been employed in searching for it, and would so continue
	till he found it, or died. This was a man after Bernard’s own heart, and
	they vowed with each other an eternal friendship. It was resolved, at
	supper, that each alchymist <a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"></a>present should contribute a certain sum
	towards raising forty-two marks of gold, which, in five days, it was
	confidently asserted by Master Henry, would increase, in his furnace,
	fivefold. Bernard, being the richest man, contributed the lion’s share,
	ten marks of gold, Master Henry five, and the others one or two a-piece,
	except the dependants of Bernard, who were obliged to borrow their quota
	from their patron. The grand experiment was duly made; the golden marks
	were put into a crucible, with a quantity of salt, copperas, aquafortis,
	egg-shells, mercury, lead, and dung. The alchymists watched this precious
	mess with intense interest, expecting that it would agglomerate into one
	lump of pure gold. At the end of three weeks they gave up the trial, upon
	some excuse that the crucible was not strong enough, or that some
	necessary ingredient was wanting. Whether any thief had put his hands into
	the crucible is not known, but it is alleged that the gold found therein
	at the close of the experiment was worth only sixteen marks, instead of
	the forty-two, which were put there at the beginning.</p>

	<p>Bernard, though he made no gold at Vienna, made away with a very
	considerable quantity. He felt the loss so acutely, that he vowed to think
	no more of the philosopher’s stone. This wise resolution he kept for two
	months; but he was miserable. He was in the condition of the gambler, who
	cannot resist the fascination of the game while he has a coin remaining,
	but plays on with the hope of retrieving former losses, till hope forsakes
	him, and he can live no longer. He returned once more to his beloved
	crucibles, and resolved to prosecute his journey in search of a
	philosopher who had discovered the secret, and would communicate it to so
	zealous and persevering an adept as himself. From Vienna he travelled to
	Rome, and from Rome to Madrid. Taking ship at Gibraltar, he proceeded to
	Messina; from Messina to Cyprus; from Cyprus to Greece; from Greece to
	Constantinople; and thence into Egypt, Palestine, and Persia. These
	wanderings occupied him about eight years. From Persia he made his way
	back to Messina, and from thence into France. He afterwards passed over
	into England, still in search of his great chimera; and this occupied four
	years more of his life. He was now growing both old and poor; for he was
	sixty-two years of age, and had been obliged to sell a great portion of
	his patrimony to provide for his expenses. His journey to Persia had cost
	upwards of thirteen thousand crowns, about one-half of which had been
	fairly melted in his all-devouring furnaces; the other half was lavished
	upon the sycophants that he made it his business to search out in every
	town he stopped at.</p>

	<p>On his return to Trèves he found, to his sorrow, that, if not an <a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"></a>actual
	beggar, he was not much better. His relatives looked upon him as a madman,
	and refused even to see him. Too proud to ask for favours from any one,
	and still confident that, some day or other, he would be the possessor of
	unbounded wealth, he made up his mind to retire to the island of Rhodes,
	where he might, in the mean time, hide his poverty from the eyes of the
	world. Here he might have lived unknown and happy; but, as ill luck would
	have it, he fell in with a monk as mad as himself upon the subject of
	transmutation. They were, however, both so poor that they could not afford
	to buy the proper materials to work with. They kept up each other’s
	spirits by learned discourses on the hermetic philosophy, and in the
	reading of all the great authors who had written upon the subject. Thus
	did they nurse their folly, as the good wife of Tam O’Shanter did her
	wrath, “to keep it warm.” After Bernard had resided about a year in
	Rhodes, a merchant, who knew his family, advanced him the sum of eight
	thousand florins, upon the security of the last-remaining acres of his
	formerly large estate. Once more provided with funds, he recommenced his
	labours with all the zeal and enthusiasm of a young man. For three years
	he hardly stepped out of his laboratory: he ate there, and slept there,
	and did not even give himself time to wash his hands and clean his beard,
	so intense was his application. It is melancholy to think that such
	wonderful perseverance should have been wasted in so vain a pursuit, and
	that energies so unconquerable should have had no worthier field to strive
	in. Even when he had fumed away his last coin, and had nothing left in
	prospective to keep his old age from starvation, hope never forsook him.
	He still dreamed of ultimate success, and sat down a grey-headed man of
	eighty, to read over all the authors on the hermetic mysteries, from Geber
	to his own day, lest he should have misunderstood some process, which it
	was not yet too late to recommence. The alchymists say, that he succeeded
	at last, and discovered the secret of transmutation in his eighty-second
	year. They add that he lived three years afterwards to enjoy his wealth.
	He lived, it is true, to this great age, and made a valuable
	discovery—more valuable than gold or gems. He learned, as he himself
	informs us, just before he had attained his eighty-third year, that the
	great secret of philosophy was contentment with our lot. Happy would it
	have been for him if he had discovered it sooner, and before he became
	decrepit, a beggar, and an exile!</p>

	<p>He died at Rhodes, in the year 1490, and all the alchymists of Europe sang
	elegies over him, and sounded his praise as the “good Trevisan.” He wrote
	several treatises upon his chimera, the chief of which are, the <cite>Book of
	Chemistry</cite>, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum dimissum</cite>, and an essay <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Natura Ovi</cite>.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist"><a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"></a>Trithemius.</h3>

	<p>The name of this eminent man has become famous in the annals of alchymy,
	although he did but little to gain so questionable an honour. He was born
	in the year 1462, at the village of Trittheim, in the electorate of
	Trèves. His father was John Heidenberg, a vine-grower, in easy
	circumstances, who, dying when his son was but seven years old, left him
	to the care of his mother. The latter married again very shortly
	afterwards, and neglected the poor boy, the offspring of her first
	marriage. At the age of fifteen he did not even know his letters, and was,
	besides, half starved, and otherwise ill-treated by his step-father; but
	the love of knowledge germinated in the breast of the unfortunate youth,
	and he learned to read at the house of a neighbour. His father-in-law set
	him to work in the vineyards, and thus occupied all his days; but the
	nights were his own. He often stole out unheeded, when all the household
	were fast asleep, poring over his studies in the fields, by the light of
	the moon; and thus taught himself Latin and the rudiments of Greek. He was
	subjected to so much ill-usage at home, in consequence of this love of
	study, that he determined to leave it. Demanding the patrimony which his
	father had left him, he proceeded to Trèves; and assuming the name of
	Trithemius, from that of his native village of Trittheim, lived there for
	some months under the tuition of eminent masters, by whom he was prepared
	for the university. At the age of twenty, he took it into his head that he
	should like to see his mother once more; and he set out on foot from the
	distant university for that purpose. On his arrival near Spannheim, late
	in the evening of a gloomy winter’s day, it came on to snow so thickly,
	that he could not proceed onwards to the town. He therefore took refuge
	for the night in a neighbouring monastery; but the storm continued several
	days, the roads became impassable, and the hospitable monks would not hear
	of his departure. He was so pleased with them and their manner of life,
	that he suddenly resolved to fix his abode among them, and renounce the
	world. They were no less pleased with him, and gladly received him as a
	brother. In the course of two years, although still so young, he was
	unanimously elected their abbot. The financial affairs of the
	establishment had been greatly neglected, the walls of the building were
	falling into ruin, and every thing was in disorder. Trithemius, by his
	good management and regularity, introduced a reform in every branch of
	expenditure. The monastery was repaired, and a yearly surplus, instead of
	a deficiency, rewarded him for his pains. He did not like to see the monks
	idle, or occupied solely between prayers for their business, and chess for
	their relaxation. He, therefore, set them <a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"></a>to work to copy the writings of
	eminent authors. They laboured so assiduously, that, in the course of a
	few years, their library, which had contained only about forty volumes,
	was enriched with several hundred valuable manuscripts, comprising many of
	the classical Latin authors, besides the works of the early fathers, and
	the principal historians, and philosophers of more modern date. He
	retained the dignity of Abbot of Spannheim for twenty-one years, when the
	monks, tired of the severe discipline he maintained, revolted against him,
	and chose another abbot in his place. He was afterwards made Abbot of St.
	James, in Wurzburg, where he died in 1516.</p>

	<p>During his learned leisure at Spannheim, he wrote several works upon the
	occult sciences, the chief of which are an essay on geomancy, or
	divination by means of lines and circles on the ground; another upon
	sorcery; a third upon alchymy; and a fourth upon the government of the
	world by its presiding angels, which was translated into English, and
	published by the famous William Lilly in 1647.</p>

	<p>It has been alleged by the believers in the possibility of transmutation,
	that the prosperity of the abbey of Spannheim, while under his
	superintendence, was owing more to the philosopher’s stone than to wise
	economy. Trithemius, in common with many other learned men, has been
	accused of magic; and a marvellous story is told of his having raised from
	the grave the form of Mary of Burgundy, at the intercession of her widowed
	husband, the Emperor Maximilian. His work on steganographia, or cabalistic
	writing, was denounced to the Count Palatine, Frederic II., as magical and
	devilish; and it was by him taken from the shelves of his library and
	thrown into the fire. Trithemius is said to be the first writer who makes
	mention of the wonderful story of the devil and Dr. Faustus, the truth of
	which he firmly believed. He also recounts the freaks of a spirit named
	<em>Hudekin</em>, by whom he was at times tormented.<a href="#fn38" id="fnm38" title="Biographie Universelle." class="fnmarker">38</a></p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">The Marechal de Rays.</h3>

	<p>One of the greatest encouragers of alchymy in the fifteenth century was
	Gilles de Laval, Lord of Rays and a Marshal of France. His name and deeds
	are little known; but in the annals of crime and folly, they might claim
	the highest and worst pre-eminence. Fiction has never invented any thing
	wilder or more horrible than his career; and were not the details but too
	well authenticated by legal and other documents which admit no doubt, the
	lover of romance might easily imagine they were drawn to please him from
	the stores of the prolific brain, and not from the page of history.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"></a>He was born about the year 1420, of one of the noblest families of
	Brittany. His father dying when Gilles had attained his twentieth year, he
	came into uncontrolled possession, at that early age, of a fortune which
	the monarchs of France might have envied him. He was a near kinsman of the
	Montmorencys, the Roncys, and the Craons; possessed fifteen princely
	domains, and had an annual revenue of about three hundred thousand livres.
	Besides this, he was handsome, learned, and brave. He distinguished
	himself greatly in the wars of Charles VII., and was rewarded by that
	monarch with the dignity of a marshal of France. But he was extravagant
	and magnificent in his style of living, and accustomed from his earliest
	years to the gratification of every wish and passion; and this, at last,
	led him from vice to vice and from crime to crime, till a blacker name
	than his is not to be found in any record of human iniquity.</p>

	<p>In his castle of Champtocé he lived with all the splendour of an eastern
	caliph. He kept up a troop of two hundred horsemen to accompany him
	wherever he went; and his excursions for the purposes of hawking and
	hunting were the wonder of all the country around, so magnificent were the
	caparisons of his steeds and the dresses of his retainers. Day and night
	his castle was open all the year round to comers of every degree. He made
	it a rule to regale even the poorest beggar with wine and hippocrass.
	Every day an ox was roasted whole in his spacious kitchens, besides sheep,
	pigs, and poultry sufficient to feed five hundred persons. He was equally
	magnificent in his devotions. His private chapel at Champtocé was the most
	beautiful in France, and far surpassed any of those in the richly-endowed
	cathedrals of Notre Dame in Paris, of Amiens, of Beauvais, or of Rouen. It
	was hung with cloth of gold and rich velvet. All the chandeliers were of
	pure gold curiously inlaid with silver. The great crucifix over the altar
	was of solid silver, and the chalices and incense-burners were of pure
	gold. He had besides a fine organ, which he caused to be carried from one
	castle to another on the shoulders of six men, whenever he changed his
	residence. He kept up a choir of twenty-five young children of both sexes,
	who were instructed in singing by the first musicians of the day. The
	master of his chapel he called a bishop, who had under him his deans,
	arch-deacons, and vicars, each receiving great salaries; the bishop four
	hundred crowns a year, and the rest in proportion.</p>

	<p>He also maintained a whole troop of players, including ten dancing girls
	and as many ballad-singers, besides morris-dancers, jugglers, and
	mountebanks of every description. The theatre on which they performed was
	fitted up without any regard to expense, and they played mysteries or
	danced the morris-dance every evening for the amusement <a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"></a>of himself and
	household, and such strangers as were sharing his prodigal hospitality.</p>

	<p>At the age of twenty-three he married Catherine, the wealthy heiress of
	the house of Touars, for whom he refurnished his castle at an expense of a
	hundred thousand crowns. His marriage was the signal for new extravagance,
	and he launched out more madly than ever he had done before; sending for
	fine singers or celebrated dancers from foreign countries to amuse him and
	his spouse; and instituting tilts and tournaments in his great court-yard
	almost every week for all the knights and nobles of the province of
	Brittany. The Duke of Brittany’s court was not half so splendid as that of
	the Maréchal de Rays. His utter disregard for wealth was so well known,
	that he was made to pay three times its value for every thing he
	purchased. His castle was filled with needy parasites and panderers to his
	pleasures, amongst whom he lavished rewards with an unsparing hand. But
	the ordinary round of sensual gratification ceased at last to afford him
	delight; he was observed to be more abstemious in the pleasures of the
	table, and to neglect the beauteous dancing girls who used formerly to
	occupy so much of his attention. He was sometimes gloomy and reserved, and
	there was an unnatural wildness in his eye which gave indications of
	incipient madness. Still his discourse was as reasonable as ever, his
	urbanity to the guests that flocked from far and near to Champtocé
	suffered no diminution; and learned priests, when they conversed with him,
	thought to themselves that few of the nobles of France were so well
	informed as Gilles de Laval. But dark rumours spread gradually over the
	country; murder, and, if possible, still more atrocious deeds were hinted
	at; and it was remarked that many young children of both sexes suddenly
	disappeared, and were never afterwards heard of. One or two had been
	traced to the castle of Champtocé, and had never been seen to leave it;
	but no one dared to accuse openly so powerful a man as the Maréchal de
	Rays. Whenever the subject of the lost children was mentioned in his
	presence, he manifested the greatest astonishment at the mystery which
	involved their fate, and indignation against those who might be guilty of
	kidnapping them. Still the world was not wholly deceived; his name became
	as formidable to young children as that of the devouring ogre in fairy
	tales, and they were taught to go miles round, rather than pass under the
	turrets of Champtocé.</p>

	<p>In the course of a few years, the reckless extravagance of the marshal
	drained him of all his funds, and he was obliged to put up some of his
	estates for sale. The Duke of Brittany entered into a treaty with him for
	the valuable seignory of Ingrande; but the heirs of Gilles implored the
	interference of Charles VII. to stay the sale. <a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"></a>Charles immediately issued
	an edict, which was confirmed by the provincial Parliament of Brittany,
	forbidding him to alienate his paternal estates. Gilles had no alternative
	but to submit. He had nothing to support his extravagance but his
	allowance as a marshal of France, which did not cover the one-tenth of his
	expenses. A man of his habits and character could not retrench his
	wasteful expenditure, and live reasonably; he could not dismiss without a
	pang his horsemen, his jesters, his morris-dancers, his choristers, and
	his parasites, or confine his hospitality to those who really needed it.
	Notwithstanding his diminished resources, he resolved to live as he had
	lived before, and turn alchymist, that he might make gold out of iron, and
	be still the wealthiest and most magnificent among the nobles of Brittany.</p>

	<p>In pursuance of this determination, he sent to Paris, Italy, Germany, and
	Spain, inviting all the adepts in the science to visit him at Champtocé.
	The messengers he despatched on this mission were two of his most needy
	and unprincipled dependants, Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Bricqueville.
	The latter, the obsequious panderer to his most secret and abominable
	pleasures, he had entrusted with the education of his motherless daughter,
	a child but five years of age, with permission that he might marry her at
	the proper time to any person he chose, or to himself if he liked it
	better. This man entered into the new plans of his master with great zeal,
	and introduced to him one Prelati, an alchymist of Padua, and a physician
	of Poitou, who was addicted to the same pursuits.</p>

	<p>The marshal caused a splendid laboratory to be fitted up for them, and the
	three commenced the search for the philosopher’s stone. They were soon
	afterwards joined by another pretended philosopher, named Anthony Palermo,
	who aided in their operations for upwards of a year. They all fared
	sumptuously at the marshal’s expense, draining him of the ready money he
	possessed, and leading him on from day to day with the hope that they
	would succeed in the object of their search. From time to time new
	aspirants from the remotest parts of Europe arrived at his castle, and for
	months he had upwards of twenty alchymists at work, trying to transmute
	copper into gold; and wasting the gold which was still his own in drugs
	and elixirs.</p>

	<p>But the Lord of Rays was not a man to abide patiently their lingering
	processes. Pleased with their comfortable quarters, they jogged on from
	day to day, and would have done so for years, had they been permitted. But
	he suddenly dismissed them all, with the exception of the Italian Prelati,
	and the physician of Poitou. These he retained to aid him to discover the
	secret of the philosopher’s <a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"></a>stone by a bolder method. The Poitousan had
	persuaded him that the devil was the great depository of that and all
	other secrets, and that he would raise him before Gilles, who might enter
	into any contract he pleased with him. Gilles expressed his readiness, and
	promised to give the devil any thing but his soul, or do any deed that the
	arch-enemy might impose upon him. Attended solely by the physician, he
	proceeded at midnight to a wild-looking place in a neighbouring forest;
	the physician drew a magic circle around them on the sward, and muttered
	for half an hour an invocation to the evil spirit to arise at his bidding,
	and disclose the secrets of alchymy. Gilles looked on with intense
	interest, and expected every moment to see the earth open, and deliver to
	his gaze the great enemy of mankind. At last the eyes of the physician
	became fixed, his hair stood on end, and he spoke, as if addressing the
	fiend. But Gilles saw nothing except his companion. At last the physician
	fell down on the sward as if insensible. Gilles looked calmly on to see
	the end. After a few minutes the physician arose, and asked him if he had
	not seen how angry the devil looked? Gilles replied that he had seen
	nothing; upon which his companion informed him that Beelzebub had appeared
	in the form of a wild leopard, growled at him savagely, and said nothing;
	and that the reason why the marshal had neither seen nor heard him was,
	that he hesitated in his own mind as to devoting himself entirely to the
	service. De Rays owned that he had indeed misgivings, and inquired what
	was to be done to make the devil speak out, and unfold his secret? The
	physician replied, that some person must go to Spain and Africa to collect
	certain herbs which only grew in those countries, and offered to go
	himself, if De Rays would provide the necessary funds. De Rays at once
	consented; and the physician set out on the following day with all the
	gold that his dupe could spare him. The marshal never saw his face again.</p>

	<p>But the eager Lord of Champtocé could not rest. Gold was necessary for his
	pleasures; and unless by supernatural aid, he had no means of procuring
	any further supplies. The physician was hardly twenty leagues on his
	journey, before Gilles resolved to make another effort to force the devil
	to divulge the art of gold-making. He went out alone for that purpose; but
	all his conjurations were of no effect. Beelzebub was obstinate, and would
	not appear. Determined to conquer him if he could, he unbosomed himself to
	the Italian alchymist, Prelati. The latter offered to undertake the
	business, upon condition that De Rays did not interfere in the
	conjurations, and consented besides to furnish him with all the charms and
	talismans that might be required. He was further to open a vein in his
	arm, and sign with his <a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"></a>blood a contract that “he would work the devil’s
	will in all things,” and offer up to him a sacrifice of the heart, lungs,
	hands, eyes, and blood of a young child. The grasping monomaniac made no
	hesitation, but agreed at once to the disgusting terms proposed to him. On
	the following night, Prelati went out alone, and after having been absent
	for three or four hours, returned to Gilles, who sat anxiously awaiting
	him. Prelati then informed him that he had seen the devil in the shape of
	a handsome youth of twenty. He further said, that the devil desired to be
	called <em>Barron</em> in all future invocations; and had shewn him a great
	number of ingots of pure gold, buried under a large oak in the
	neighbouring forest, all of which, and as many more as he desired, should
	become the property of the Maréchal de Rays if he remained firm, and broke
	no condition of the contract. Prelati further shewed him a small casket of
	black dust, which would turn iron into gold; but as the process was very
	troublesome, he advised that they should be contented with the ingots they
	found under the oak tree, and which would more than supply all the wants
	that the most extravagant imagination could desire. They were not,
	however, to attempt to look for the gold till a period of seven times
	seven weeks, or they would find nothing but slates and stones for their
	pains. Gilles expressed the utmost chagrin and disappointment, and at once
	said that he could not wait for so long a period; if the devil were not
	more, prompt Prelati might tell him that the Maréchal de Rays was not to
	be trifled with, and would decline all further communication with him.
	Prelati at last persuaded him to wait seven times seven days. They then
	went at midnight with picks and shovels to dig up the ground under the
	oak, where they found nothing to reward them but a great quantity of
	slates, marked with hieroglyphics. It was now Prelati’s turn to be angry;
	and he loudly swore that the devil was nothing but a liar and a cheat. The
	marshal joined cordially in the opinion, but was easily persuaded by the
	cunning Italian to make one more trial. He promised at the same time that
	he would endeavour on the following night to discover the reason why the
	devil had broken his word. He went out alone accordingly, and on his
	return informed his patron that he had seen Barron, who was exceedingly
	angry that they had not waited the proper time ere they looked for the
	ingots. Barron had also said, that the Maréchal de Rays could hardly
	expect any favours from him, at a time when he must know that he had been
	meditating a pilgrimage to the Holy Land to make atonement for his sins.
	The Italian had doubtless surmised this from some incautious expression of
	his patron, for de Rays frankly confessed that there were times when, sick
	of the world and all its pomps and vanities, he thought of devoting
	himself to the service of God.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"></a>In this manner the Italian lured on from month to month his credulous and
	guilty patron, extracting from him all the valuables he possessed, and
	only waiting a favourable opportunity to decamp with his plunder. But the
	day of retribution was at hand for both. Young girls and boys continued to
	disappear in the most mysterious manner; and the rumours against the owner
	of Champtocé grew so loud and distinct, that the Church was compelled to
	interfere. Representations were made by the Bishop of Nantes to the Duke
	of Brittany, that it would be a public scandal if the accusations against
	the Maréchal de Rays were not inquired into. He was arrested accordingly
	in his own castle, along with his accomplice Prelati, and thrown into a
	dungeon at Nantes to await his trial.</p>

	<p>The judges appointed to try him were the Bishop of Nantes Chancellor of
	Brittany, the Vicar of the Inquisition in France, and the celebrated
	Pierre l’Hôpital, the President of the provincial Parliament. The offences
	laid to his charge were, sorcery, sodomy, and murder. Gilles, on the first
	day of his trial, conducted himself with the utmost insolence. He braved
	the judges on the judgment-seat, calling them simoniacs and persons of
	impure life, and said he would rather be hanged by the neck like a dog
	without trial, than plead either guilty or not guilty before such
	contemptible miscreants. But his confidence forsook him as the trial
	proceeded, and he was found guilty on the clearest evidence of all the
	crimes laid to his charge. It was proved that he took insane pleasure in
	stabbing the victims of his lust and in observing the quivering of their
	flesh, and the fading lustre of their eyes as they expired. The confession
	of Prelati first made the judges acquainted with this horrid madness, and
	Gilles himself confirmed it before his death. Nearly a hundred children of
	the villagers around his two castles of Champtocé and Machecoue, had been
	missed within three years, the greater part, if not all, of whom were
	immolated to the lust or the cupidity of this monster. He imagined that he
	thus made the devil his friend, and that his recompense would be the
	secret of the philosopher’s stone.</p>

	<p>Gilles and Prelati were both condemned to be burned alive. At the place of
	execution they assumed the air of penitence and religion. Gilles tenderly
	embraced Prelati, saying, “<em>Farewell, friend Francis! In this world we
	shall never meet again; but let us place our hopes in God; we shall see
	each other in Paradise.</em>” Out of consideration for his high rank and
	connexions, the punishment of the marshal was so far mitigated, that he
	was not burned alive like Prelati. He was first strangled, and then thrown
	into the flames: his body, when half consumed, was given over to his
	relatives for interment, while <a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"></a>that of the Italian was burned to ashes,
	and then scattered to the winds.<a href="#fn39" id="fnm39" title="For full details..." class="fnmarker">39</a></p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Jacques Cœur.</h3>

	<p>This remarkable pretender to the secret of the philosopher’s stone was
	contemporary with the last mentioned. He was a great personage at the
	court of Charles VII., and in the events of his reign played a prominent
	part. From a very humble origin he rose to the highest honours of the
	state, and amassed enormous wealth by peculation and plunder of the
	country which he should have served. It was to hide his delinquencies in
	this respect, and to divert attention from the real source of his riches,
	that he boasted of having discovered the art of transmuting the inferior
	metals into gold and silver.</p>

	<p>His father was a goldsmith in the city of Bourges; but so reduced in
	circumstances towards the latter years of his life, that he was unable to
	pay the necessary fees to procure his son’s admission into the guild.
	Young Jacques became, however, a workman in the Royal Mint of Bourges, in
	1428, and behaved himself so well, and shewed so much knowledge of
	metallurgy, that he attained rapid promotion in that establishment. He had
	also the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the fair Agnes Sorel, by
	whom he was patronised and much esteemed. Jacques had now three things in
	his favour—ability, perseverance, and the countenance of the king’s
	mistress. Many a man succeeds with but one of these to help him forward;
	and it would have been strange indeed if Jacques Cœur, who had them all,
	should have languished in obscurity. While still a young man, he was made
	master of the mint, in which he had been a journeyman, and installed at
	the same time into the vacant office of grand treasurer of the royal
	household.</p>

	<p>He possessed an extensive knowledge of finance, and turned it wonderfully
	to his own advantage, as soon as he became entrusted with extensive funds.
	He speculated in articles of the first necessity, and made himself popular
	by buying up grain, honey, wines, and other produce, till there was a
	scarcity, when he sold it again at enormous profit. Strong in the royal
	favour, he did not hesitate to oppress the poor by continual acts of
	forestalling and monopoly. As there is no enemy so bitter as the estranged
	friend, so of all the tyrants and tramplers upon the poor, there is none
	so fierce and reckless as the upstart that sprang from their ranks. The
	offensive pride of Jacques Cœur to his inferiors was the theme of
	indignant reproach in <a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"></a>his own city, and his cringing humility to those
	above him was as much an object of contempt to the aristocrats into whose
	society he thrust himself. But Jacques did not care for the former, and to
	the latter he was blind. He continued his career till he became the
	richest man in France, and so useful to the king that no important
	enterprise was set on foot until he had been consulted. He was sent, in
	1446, on an embassy to Genoa, and in the following year to Pope Nicholas
	V. In both these missions he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his
	sovereign, and was rewarded with a lucrative appointment, in addition to
	those which he already held.</p>

	<p>In the year 1449, the English in Normandy, deprived of their great
	general, the Duke of Bedford, broke the truce with the French king, and
	took possession of a small town belonging to the Duke of Brittany. This
	was the signal for the recommencement of a war, in which the French
	regained possession of nearly the whole province. The money for this war
	was advanced, for the most part, by Jacques Cœur. When Rouen yielded to
	the French, and Charles made his triumphal entry into that city,
	accompanied by Dunois and his most famous generals, Jacques was among the
	most brilliant of his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</em>. His chariot and horses vied with those of
	the king in the magnificence of their trappings; and his enemies said of
	him that he publicly boasted that he alone had driven out the English, and
	that the valour of the troops would have been nothing without his gold.</p>

	<p>Dunois appears, also, to have been partly of the same opinion. Without
	disparaging the courage of the army, he acknowledged the utility of the
	able financier, by whose means they had been fed and paid, and constantly
	afforded him his powerful protection.</p>

	<p>When peace returned, Jacques again devoted himself to commerce, and fitted
	up several galleys to trade with the Genoese. He also bought large estates
	in various parts of France; the chief of which were the baronies of St.
	Fargeau, Meneton, Salone, Maubranche, Meaune, St. Gerant de Vaux, and St.
	Aon de Boissy; the earldoms or counties of La Palisse, Champignelle,
	Beaumont, and Villeneuve la Genêt, and the marquisate of Toucy. He also
	procured for his son, Jean Cœur, who had chosen the Church for his
	profession, a post no less distinguished than that of Archbishop of
	Bourges.</p>

	<p>Every body said that so much wealth could not have been honestly acquired;
	and both rich and poor longed for the day that should humble the pride of
	the man, whom the one class regarded as an upstart and the other as an
	oppressor. Jacques was somewhat alarmed at the rumours that were afloat
	respecting him, and of dark hints that he had debased the coin of the
	realm and forged the king’s seal to an important document, by which he had
	defrauded the state <a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"></a>of very considerable sums. To silence these rumours,
	he invited many alchymists from foreign countries to reside with him, and
	circulated a counter rumour, that he had discovered the secret of the
	philosopher’s stone. He also built a magnificent house in his native city,
	over the entrance of which he caused to be sculptured the emblems of that
	science. Some time afterwards he built another, no less splendid, at
	Montpellier, which he inscribed in a similar manner. He also wrote a
	treatise upon the hermetic philosophy, in which he pretended that he knew
	the secret of transmuting metals.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>But all these attempts to disguise his numerous acts of peculation proved
	unavailing; and he was arrested in 1452, and brought to trial on several
	charges. Upon one only, which the malice of his enemies invented to ruin
	him, was he acquitted; which was, that he had been accessory to the death,
	by poison, of his kind patroness, Agnes Sorel. Upon the others he was
	found guilty, and sentenced to be banished the kingdom, and to pay the
	enormous fine of four hundred thousand crowns. It was proved that he had
	forged the king’s seal; that in his capacity of master of the mint of
	Bourges, he had debased, to a very great extent, the gold and silver coin
	of the realm; and that he had not hesitated to supply the Turks with arms
	and money to enable them <a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"></a>to carry on war against their Christian
	neighbours, for which service he had received the most munificent
	recompenses. Charles VII. was deeply grieved at his condemnation, and
	believed to the last that he was innocent. By his means the fine was
	reduced within a sum which Jacques Cœur could pay. After remaining for
	some time in prison, he was liberated, and left France with a large sum of
	money, part of which, it was alleged, was secretly paid him by Charles out
	of the produce of his confiscated estates. He retired to Cyprus, where he
	died about 1460, the richest and most conspicuous personage of the island.</p>

	<p>The writers upon alchymy all claim Jacques Cœur as a member of their
	fraternity, and treat as false and libellous the more rational explanation
	of his wealth which the records of his trial afford. Pierre Borel, in his
	<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Antiquités Gauloises</cite>, maintains the opinion that Jacques was an honest
	man, and that he made his gold out of lead and copper by means of the
	philosopher’s stone. The alchymic adepts in general were of the same
	opinion; but they found it difficult to persuade even his contemporaries
	of the fact. Posterity is still less likely to believe it.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Inferior Adepts of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries.</h3>

	<p>Many other pretenders to the secrets of the philosopher’s stone appeared
	in every country in Europe, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
	The possibility of transmutation was so generally admitted, that every
	chemist was more or less an alchymist. Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain,
	Poland, France, and England produced thousands of obscure adepts, who
	supported themselves, in the pursuit of their chimera, by the more
	profitable resources of astrology and divination. The monarchs of Europe
	were no less persuaded than their subjects of the possibility of
	discovering the philosopher’s stone. Henry VI. and Edward IV. of England
	encouraged alchymy. In Germany, the Emperors Maximilian, Rudolph, and
	Frederic II. devoted much of their attention to it; and every inferior
	potentate within their dominions imitated their example. It was a common
	practice in Germany, among the nobles and petty sovereigns, to invite an
	alchymist to take up his residence among them, that they might confine him
	in a dungeon till he made gold enough to pay millions for his ransom. Many
	poor wretches suffered perpetual imprisonment in consequence. A similar
	fate appears to have been intended by Edward II. for Raymond Lulli, who,
	upon the pretence that he was thereby honoured, was accommodated with
	apartments in the Tower of London. He found out in time the trick that was
	about to be played him, and managed to make his escape; some of his
	biographers say, by jumping into the Thames, and swimming to a vessel <a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"></a>that
	lay waiting to receive him. In the sixteenth century, the same system was
	pursued, as will be shewn more fully in the life of Seton the Cosmopolite.</p>

	<p>The following is a catalogue of the chief authors upon alchymy, who
	flourished during this epoch, and whose lives and adventures are either
	unknown or are unworthy of more detailed notice. John Dowston, an
	Englishman, lived in 1315, and wrote two treatises on the philosopher’s
	stone. Richard, or, as some call him, Robert, also an Englishman, lived in
	1330, and wrote a work entitled <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Correctorium Alchymiæ</cite>, which was much
	esteemed till the time of Paracelsus. In the same year lived Peter of
	Lombardy, who wrote what he called a <cite>Complete Treatise upon the Hermetic
	Science</cite>, an abridgment of which was afterwards published by Lacini, a
	monk of Calabria. In 1330 the most famous alchymist of Paris was one
	Odomare, whose work, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Practica Magistri</cite>, was for a long time a
	hand-book among the brethren of the science. John de Rupecissa, a French
	monk of the order of St. Francis, flourished in 1357, and pretended to be
	a prophet as well as an alchymist. Some of his prophecies were so
	disagreeable to Pope Innocent VI., that the pontiff determined to put a
	stop to them, by locking up the prophet in the dungeons of the Vatican. It
	is generally believed that he died there, though there is no evidence of
	the fact. His chief works are, the <cite>Book of Light</cite>, the <cite>Five Essences</cite>,
	the <cite>Heaven of Philosophers</cite>, and his grand work, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Confectione
	Lapidis</cite>. He was not thought a shining light among the adepts. Ortholani
	was another pretender, of whom nothing is known, but that he exercised the
	arts of alchymy and astrology at Paris, shortly before the time of
	Nicholas Flamel. His work on the practice of alchymy was written in that
	city in 1358. Isaac of Holland wrote, it is supposed, about this time; and
	his son also devoted himself to the science. Nothing worth repeating is
	known of their lives. Boerhaave speaks with commendation of many passages
	in their works, and Paracelsus esteemed them highly: the chief are, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
	Triplici Ordine Elixiris et Lapidis Theoria</cite>, printed at Berne in 1608;
	and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mineralia Opera, seu de Lapide Philosophico</cite>, printed at Middleburg
	in 1600. They also wrote eight other works upon the same subject.
	Koffstky, a Pole, wrote an alchymical treatise, entitled <cite>The Tincture of
	Minerals</cite>, about the year 1488. In this list of authors a royal name must
	not be forgotten. Charles VI. of France, one of the most credulous princes
	of the day, whose court absolutely swarmed with alchymists, conjurers,
	astrologers, and quacks of every description, made several attempts to
	discover the philosopher’s stone, and thought he knew so much about it,
	that he determined to enlighten the world with a treatise; it is called
	the <cite>Royal Work of Charles VI. of France, and the Treasure of Philosophy</cite>.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"></a>It is said to be the original from which Nicholas Flamel took the idea of
	his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Désir désiré</cite>. Lenglet du Fresnoy says it is very allegorical, and
	utterly incomprehensible. For a more complete list of the hermetic
	philosophers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the reader is
	referred to the third volume of Lenglet’s History, already quoted.</p>

	<h3>PROGRESS OF THE INFATUATION DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES.—PRESENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE.</h3>
	
	<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the search for the
	philosopher’s stone was continued by thousands of the enthusiastic and the
	credulous; but a great change was introduced during this period. The
	eminent men who devoted themselves to the study totally changed its
	aspect, and referred to the possession of their wondrous stone and elixir,
	not only the conversion of the base into the precious metals, but the
	solution of all the difficulties of other sciences. They pretended that by
	its means man would be brought into closer communion with his Maker; that
	disease and sorrow would be banished from the world; and that “the
	millions of spiritual beings who walk the earth unseen” would be rendered
	visible, and become the friends, companions, and instructors of mankind.
	In the seventeenth century more especially, these poetical and fantastic
	doctrines excited the notice of Europe; and from Germany, where they had
	been first disseminated by Rosencreutz, spread into France and England,
	and ran away with the sound judgment of many clever but too enthusiastic
	searchers for the truth. Paracelsus, Dee, and many others of less note,
	were captivated by the grace and beauty of the new mythology, which was
	arising to adorn the literature of Europe. Most of the alchymists of the
	sixteenth century, although ignorant of the Rosicrucians as a sect, were,
	in some degree, tinctured with their fanciful tenets: but before we speak
	more fully of these poetical visionaries, it will be necessary to resume
	the history of the hermetic folly, and trace the gradual change that stole
	over the dreams of the adepts. It will be seen that the infatuation
	increased rather than diminished as the world grew older.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Augurello.</h3>

	<p>Among the alchymists who were born in the fifteenth, and distinguished
	themselves in the sixteenth century, the first in point of date is John
	Aurelio Augurello. He was born at Rimini in 1441, and became professor of
	the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</em> at Venice and Trevisa. He was early convinced of the
	truth of the hermetic science, and used to pray <a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"></a>to God that he might be
	happy enough to discover the philosopher’s stone. He was continually
	surrounded by the paraphernalia of chemistry, and expended all his wealth
	in the purchase of drugs and metals. He was also a poet, but of less merit
	than pretensions. His <cite>Chrysopeia</cite>, in which he pretended to teach the art
	of making gold, he dedicated to Pope Leo X., in the hope that the pontiff
	would reward him handsomely for the compliment; but the pope was too good
	a judge of poetry to be pleased with the worse than mediocrity of his
	poem, and too good a philosopher to approve of the strange doctrines which
	it inculcated; he was, therefore, far from gratified at the dedication. It
	is said, that when Augurello applied to him for a reward, the pope, with
	great ceremony and much apparent kindness and cordiality, drew an empty
	purse from his pocket, and presented it to the alchymist, saying, that
	since he was able to make gold, the most appropriate present that could be
	made him, was a purse to put it in. This scurvy reward was all that the
	poor alchymist ever got either for his poetry or his alchymy. He died in a
	state of extreme poverty, in the eighty-third year of his age.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Cornelius Agrippa.</h3>

	<p>This alchymist has left a distinguished reputation.  The most
	extraordinary tales were told and believed of his powers. He could turn
	iron into gold by his mere word. All the spirits of the air and demons of
	the earth were under his command, and bound to obey him in everything. He
	could raise from the dead the forms of the great men of other days, and
	make them appear, “in their habit as they lived,” to the gaze of the
	curious who had courage enough to abide their presence.</p>
	
	<div class="figleft" style="width:191px;">

		<p class="caption">CORNELIUS AGRIPPA.</p>
	</div>

	<p>He was born at Cologne in 1486, and began at an early age the study of
	chemistry and philosophy. By some means or other, which have never been
	very clearly explained, he managed to impress his contemporaries with a
	great idea of his wonderful attainments. <a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"></a>At the early age of twenty, so
	great was his reputation as an alchymist, that the principal adepts of
	Paris wrote to Cologne, inviting him to settle in France, and aid them
	with his experience in discovering the philosopher’s stone. Honours poured
	upon him in thick succession; and he was highly esteemed by all the
	learned men of his time. Melancthon speaks of him with respect and
	commendation. Erasmus also bears testimony in his favour; and the general
	voice of his age proclaimed him a light of literature and an ornament to
	philosophy. Some men, by dint of excessive egotism, manage to persuade
	their contemporaries that they are very great men indeed: they publish
	their acquirements so loudly in people’s ears, and keep up their own
	praises so incessantly, that the world’s applause is actually taken by
	storm. Such seems to have been the case with Agrippa. He called himself a
	sublime theologian, an excellent jurisconsult, an able physician, a great
	philosopher, and a successful alchymist. The world at last took him at his
	word; and thought that a man who talked so big, must have some merit to
	recommend him,—that it was, indeed, a great trumpet which sounded so
	obstreperous a blast. He was made secretary to the Emperor Maximilian, who
	conferred upon him the title of chevalier, and gave him the honorary
	command of a regiment. He afterwards became professor of Hebrew and the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</em> at the University of Dôle, in France; but quarrelling
	with the Franciscan monks upon some knotty points of divinity, he was
	obliged to quit the town. He took refuge in London, where he taught Hebrew
	and cast nativities, for about a year. From London he proceeded to Pavia,
	and gave lectures upon the writings, real or supposed, of Hermes
	Trismegistus; and might have lived there in peace and honour, had he not
	again quarrelled with the clergy. By their means his position became so
	disagreeable that he was glad to accept an offer made him by the
	magistracy of Metz, to become their syndic and advocate-general. Here,
	again, his love of disputation made him enemies: the theological wiseacres
	of that city asserted that St. Ann had three husbands, in which opinion
	they were confirmed by the popular belief of the day. Agrippa needlessly
	ran foul of this opinion, or prejudice as he called it, and thereby lost
	much of his influence. Another dispute, more creditable to his character,
	occurred soon after, and sank him for ever in the estimation of the
	Metzians. Humanely taking the part of a young girl who was accused of
	witchcraft, his enemies asserted that he was himself a sorcerer, and
	raised such a storm over his head, that he was forced to fly the city.
	After this he became physician to Louisa de Savoy, mother of King Francis
	I. This lady was curious to know the future, and required her physician to
	cast her nativity. Agrippa replied that <a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"></a>he would not encourage such idle
	curiosity. The result was, he lost her confidence, and was forthwith
	dismissed. If it had been through his belief in the worthlessness of
	astrology, that he had made his answer, we might admire his honest and
	fearless independence; but when it is known that, at the very same time,
	he was in the constant habit of divination and fortune-telling, and that
	he was predicting splendid success, in all his undertakings, to the
	Constable of Bourbon, we can only wonder at his thus estranging a powerful
	friend through mere petulance and perversity.</p>

	<p>He was about this time invited, both by Henry VIII. of England, and
	Margaret of Austria, governess of the Low Countries, to fix his residence
	in their dominions. He chose the service of the latter, by whose influence
	he was made historiographer to the Emperor Charles V. Unfortunately for
	Agrippa, he never had stability enough to remain long in one position, and
	offended his patrons by his restlessness and presumption. After the death
	of Margaret he was imprisoned at Brussels, on a charge of sorcery. He was
	released after a year; and quitting the country, experienced many
	vicissitudes. He died in great poverty in 1534, aged forty-eight years.</p>

	<p>While in the service of Margaret of Austria, he resided principally at
	Louvain, in which city he wrote his famous work on the <cite>Vanity and
	Nothingness of Human Knowledge</cite>. He also wrote to please his royal
	mistress, a treatise upon the <cite>Superiority of the Female Sex</cite>, which he
	dedicated to her in token of his gratitude for the favours she had heaped
	upon him. The reputation he left behind him in these provinces was any
	thing but favourable. A great number of the marvellous tales that are told
	of him relate to this period of his life. It was said, that the gold which
	he paid to the traders with whom he dealt, always looked remarkably
	bright, but invariably turned into pieces of slate and stone in the course
	of four-and-twenty hours. Of this spurious gold he was believed to have
	made large quantities by the aid of the devil, who, it would appear from
	this, had but a very superficial knowledge of alchymy, and much less than
	the Maréchal de Rays gave him credit for. The Jesuit Delrio, in his book
	on magic and sorcery, relates a still more extraordinary story of him. One
	day, Agrippa left his house at Louvain, and intending to be absent for
	some time, gave the key of his study to his wife, with strict orders that
	no one should enter it during his absence. The lady herself, strange as it
	may appear, had no curiosity to pry into her husband’s secrets, and never
	once thought of entering the forbidden room; but a young student, who had
	been accommodated with an attic in the philosopher’s house, burned with a
	fierce desire to examine the study; hoping, perchance, that he might
	purloin <a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"></a>some book or implement which would instruct him in the art of
	transmuting metals. The youth, being handsome, eloquent, and, above all,
	highly complimentary to the charms of the lady, she was persuaded without
	much difficulty to lend him the key, but gave him strict orders not to
	remove any thing. The student promised implicit obedience, and entered
	Agrippa’s study. The first object that caught his attention was a large
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grimoire</em>, or book of spells, which lay open on the philosopher’s desk.
	He sat himself down immediately and began to read. At the first word he
	uttered, he fancied he heard a knock at the door. He listened, but all was
	silent. Thinking that his imagination had deceived him, he read on, when
	immediately a louder knock was heard, which so terrified him, that he
	started to his feet. He tried to say “Come in,” but his tongue refused its
	office, and he could not articulate a sound. He fixed his eyes upon the
	door, which, slowly opening, disclosed a stranger of majestic form, but
	scowling features, who demanded sternly, why he was summoned? “I did not
	summon you,” said the trembling student. “You did!” said the stranger,
	advancing angrily; “and the demons are not to be invoked in vain.” The
	student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the
	uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized him
	by the throat and strangled him. When Agrippa returned, a few days
	afterwards, he found his house beset with devils. Some of them were
	sitting on the chimney-pots, kicking up their legs in the air; while
	others were playing at leapfrog on the very edge of the parapet. His study
	was so filled with them, that he found it difficult to make his way to his
	desk. When, at last, he had elbowed his way through them, he found his
	book open, and the student lying dead upon the floor. He saw immediately
	how the mischief had been done; and dismissing all the inferior imps,
	asked the principal demon how he could have been so rash as to kill the
	young man. The demon replied, that he had been needlessly invoked by an
	insulting youth, and could do no less than kill him for his presumption.
	Agrippa reprimanded him severely, and ordered him immediately to reanimate
	the dead body, and walk about with it in the market-place for the whole of
	the afternoon. The demon did so; the student revived, and putting his arm
	through that of his unearthly murderer, walked very lovingly with him in
	sight of all the people. At sunset, the body fell down again, cold and
	lifeless as before, and was carried by the crowd to the hospital, it being
	the general opinion that he had expired in a fit of apoplexy. His
	conductor immediately disappeared. When the body was examined, marks of
	strangulation were found on the neck, and prints of the long claws of the
	demon on various parts of it. These <a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"></a>appearances, together with a story,
	which soon obtained currency, that the companion of the young man had
	vanished in a cloud of flame and smoke, opened people’s eyes to the truth.
	The magistrates of Louvain instituted inquiries, and the result was, that
	Agrippa was obliged to quit the town.</p>

	<p>Other authors besides Delrio relate similar stories of this philosopher.
	The world in those days was always willing enough to believe in tales of
	magic and sorcery; and when, as in Agrippa’s case, the alleged magician
	gave himself out for such, and claimed credit for the wonders he worked,
	it is not surprising that the age should have allowed his pretensions. It
	was dangerous boasting, which sometimes led to the stake or the gallows,
	and therefore was thought to be not without foundation. Paulus Jovius, in
	his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eulogia Doctorum Virorum</cite>, says, that the devil, in the shape of a
	large black dog, attended Agrippa wherever he went. Thomas Nash, in his
	<cite>Adventures of Jack Wilton</cite>, relates, that, at the request of Lord Surrey,
	Erasmus, and some other learned men, Agrippa called up from the grave many
	of the great philosophers of antiquity; among others, Tully, whom he
	caused to re-deliver his celebrated oration for Roscius. He also shewed
	Lord Surrey, when in Germany, an exact resemblance in a glass of his
	mistress, the fair Geraldine. She was represented on a couch weeping for
	the absence of her lover. Lord Surrey made a note of the exact time at
	which he saw this vision, and ascertained afterwards that his mistress was
	actually so employed at the very minute. To Thomas Lord Cromwell, Agrippa
	represented King Henry VIII. hunting in Windsor Park, with the principal
	lords of his court; and to please the Emperor Charles V. he summoned King
	David and King Solomon from the tomb.</p>

	<p>Naudé, in his “<cite>Apology for the great Men who have been falsely suspected
	of Magic</cite>,” takes a great deal of pains to clear Agrippa from the
	imputations cast upon him by Delrio, Paulus Jovius, and other such
	ignorant and prejudiced scribblers. Such stories demanded refutation in
	the days of Naudé, but they may now be safely left to decay in their own
	absurdity. That they should have attached, however, to the memory of a man
	who claimed the power of making iron obey him when he told it to become
	gold, and who wrote such a work as that upon magic, which goes by his
	name, is not at all surprising.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Paracelsus.</h3>

	<p>This philosopher, called by Naudé “the zenith and rising sun of all the
	alchymists,” was born at Einsiedeln, near Zurich, in the year 1493. His
	true name was Hohenheim; to which, as he himself informs us, were prefixed
	the baptismal names of Aureolus Theophrastus <a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"></a>Bombastes Paracelsus. The
	last of these he chose for his common designation while he was yet a boy;
	and rendered it, before he died, one of the most famous in the annals of
	his time. His father, who was a physician, educated his son for the same
	pursuit. The latter was an apt scholar, and made great progress. By chance
	the work of Isaac Hollandus fell into his hands, and from that time he
	became smitten with the mania of the philosopher’s stone. All his thoughts
	henceforth were devoted to metallurgy; and he travelled into Sweden that
	he might visit the mines of that country, and examine the ores while they
	yet lay in the bowels of the earth. He also visited Trithemius at the
	monastery of Spannheim, and obtained instructions from him in the science
	of alchymy. Continuing his travels, he proceeded through Prussia and
	Austria into Turkey, Egypt, and Tartary, and thence returning to
	Constantinople, learned, as he boasted, the art of transmutation, and
	became possessed of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>. He then established himself as a
	physician in his native Switzerland at Zurich, and commenced writing works
	upon alchymy and medicine, which immediately fixed the attention of
	Europe. Their great obscurity was no impediment to their fame; for the
	less the author was understood, the more the demonologists, fanatics, and
	philosopher’s-stone hunters seemed to appreciate him. His fame as a
	physician kept pace with that which he enjoyed as an alchymist, owing to
	his having effected some happy cures by means of mercury and opium,—drugs
	unceremoniously condemned by his professional brethren. In the year 1526,
	he was chosen professor of physics and natural philosophy in the
	University of Basle, where his lectures attracted vast numbers of
	students. He denounced the writings of all former physicians as tending to
	mislead; and publicly burned the works of Galen and Avicenna, as quacks
	and impostors. He exclaimed, in presence of the admiring and
	half-bewildered crowd, who assembled to witness the ceremony, that there
	was more knowledge in his shoe-strings than in the writings of these
	physicians. Continuing in the same strain, he said, all the Universities
	in the world were full of ignorant quacks; but that he, Paracelsus,
	overflowed with wisdom. “You will all follow my new system,” said he, with
	furious gesticulations, “Avicenna, Galen, Rhazis, Montagnana, Memé,—you
	will all follow me, ye professors of Paris, Montpellier, <a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"></a>Germany, Cologne,
	and Vienna! and all ye that dwell on the Rhine and the Danube,—ye that
	inhabit the isles of the sea; and ye also, Italians, Dalmatians,
	Athenians, Arabians, Jews,—ye will all follow my doctrines, for I am the
	monarch of medicine!”</p>

		<p class="caption">PARACELSUS.</p>

	<p>But he did not long enjoy the esteem of the good citizens of Basle. It is
	said that he indulged in wine so freely, as not unfrequently to be seen in
	the streets in a state of intoxication. This was ruinous for a physician,
	and his good fame decreased rapidly. His ill fame increased in still
	greater proportion, especially when he assumed the airs of a sorcerer. He
	boasted of the legions of spirits at his command; and of one especially,
	which he kept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword. Wetteras, who lived
	twenty-seven months in his service, relates that he often threatened to
	invoke a whole army of demons, and shew him the great authority which he
	could exercise over them. He let it be believed that the spirit in his
	sword had custody of the elixir of life, by means of which he could make
	any one live to be as old as the antediluvians. He also boasted that he
	had a spirit at his command, called “Azoth,” whom he kept imprisoned in a
	jewel; and in many of the old portraits he is represented with a jewel,
	inscribed with the word “Azoth, in his hand.”</p>

	<p>If a sober prophet has little honour in his own country, a drunken one has
	still less. Paracelsus found it at last convenient to quit Basle, and
	establish himself at Strasbourg. The immediate cause of this change of
	residence was as follows. A citizen lay at the point of death, and was
	given over by all the physicians of the town. As a last resource
	Paracelsus was called in, to whom the sick man promised a magnificent
	recompense, if, by his means, he were cured. Paracelsus gave him two small
	pills, which the man took, and rapidly recovered. When he was quite well,
	Paracelsus sent for his fee; but the citizen had no great opinion of the
	value of a cure which had been so speedily effected. He had no notion of
	paying a handful of gold for two pills, although they had saved his life,
	and he refused to pay more than the usual fee for a single visit.
	Paracelsus brought an action against him, and lost it. This result so
	exasperated him, that he left Basle in high dudgeon. He resumed his
	wandering life, and travelled in Germany and Hungary, supporting himself
	as he went on the credulity and infatuation of all classes of society. He
	cast nativities—told fortunes—aided those who had money to throw away
	upon the experiment, to find the philosopher’s stone—prescribed remedies
	for cows and pigs, and aided in the recovery of stolen goods. After
	residing successively at Nuremburg, Augsburg, Vienna, and Mindelheim, he
	retired in the year 1541 to Saltzbourg, and died in a state of abject
	poverty in the hospital of that town.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"></a>If this strange charlatan found hundreds of admirers during his life, he
	found thousands after his death. A sect of Paracelsists sprang up in
	France and Germany, to perpetuate the extravagant doctrines of their
	founder upon all the sciences, and upon alchymy in particular. The chief
	leaders were Bodenstein and Dorneus. The following is a summary of his
	doctrine, founded upon the supposed existence of the philosopher’s stone;
	it is worth preserving from its very absurdity, and is altogether
	unparalleled in the history of philosophy. First of all, he maintained
	that the contemplation of the perfection of the Deity sufficed to procure
	all wisdom and knowledge; that the Bible was the key to the theory of all
	diseases, and that it was necessary to search into the Apocalypse to know
	the signification of magic medicine. The man who blindly obeyed the will
	of God, and who succeeded in identifying himself with the celestial
	intelligences, possessed the philosopher’s stone—he could cure all
	diseases, and prolong life to as many centuries as he pleased; it being by
	the very same means that Adam and the antediluvian patriarchs prolonged
	theirs. Life was an emanation from the stars—the sun governed the heart,
	and the moon the brain. Jupiter governed the liver, Saturn the gall,
	Mercury the lungs, Mars the bile, and Venus the loins. In the stomach of
	every human being there dwelt a demon, or intelligence, that was a sort of
	alchymist in his way, and mixed, in their due proportions, in his
	crucible, the various aliments that were sent into that grand laboratory,
	the belly.<a href="#fn40" id="fnm40" title="See the article..." class="fnmarker">40</a> He was proud of the title of magician, and boasted that
	he kept up a regular correspondence with Galen from hell; and that he
	often summoned Avicenna from the same regions to dispute with him on the
	false notions he had promulgated respecting alchymy, and especially
	regarding potable gold and the elixir of life. He imagined that gold could
	cure ossification of the heart, and, in fact, all diseases, if it were
	gold which had been transmuted from an inferior metal by means of the
	philosopher’s stone, and if it were applied under certain conjunctions of
	the planets. The mere list of the works in which he advances these frantic
	imaginings, which he called a doctrine, would occupy several pages.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">George Agricola.</h3>

	<p>This alchymist was born in the province of Misnia, in 1494. His real name
	was <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bauer</em>, meaning a husbandman, which, in accordance with the common
	fashion of his age, he latinised into Agricola. From his early youth, he
	delighted in the visions of the hermetic science. Ere he was sixteen, he
	longed for the great elixir which was to make him live for seven hundred
	years, and for the stone which <a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"></a>was to procure him wealth to cheer him in
	his multiplicity of days. He published a small treatise upon the subject
	at Cologne, in 1531, which obtained him the patronage of the celebrated
	Maurice duke of Saxony. After practising for some years as a physician at
	Joachimsthal, in Bohemia, he was employed by Maurice as superintendent of
	the silver mines of Chemnitz. He led a happy life among the miners, making
	various experiments in alchymy while deep in the bowels of the earth. He
	acquired a great knowledge of metals, and gradually got rid of his
	extravagant notions about the philosopher’s stone. The miners had no faith
	in alchymy; and they converted him to their way of thinking, not only in
	that but in other respects. From their legends, he became firmly convinced
	that the bowels of the earth were inhabited by good and evil spirits, and
	that firedamp and other explosions sprang from no other causes than the
	mischievous propensities of the latter. He died in the year 1555, leaving
	behind him the reputation of a very able and intelligent man.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Denis Zachaire.</h3>

	<p>Autobiography, written by a wise man who was once a fool, is not only the
	most instructive, but the most delightful of reading. Denis Zachaire, an
	alchymist of the sixteenth century, has performed this task, and left a
	record of his folly and infatuation in pursuit of the philosopher’s stone,
	which well repays perusal. He was born in the year 1510, of an ancient
	family in Guienne, and was early sent to the university of Bordeaux, under
	the care of a tutor to direct his studies. Unfortunately his tutor was a
	searcher for the grand elixir, and soon rendered his pupil as mad as
	himself upon the subject. With this introduction, we will allow Denis
	Zachaire to speak for himself, and continue his narrative in his own
	words: “I received from home,” says he, “the sum of two hundred crowns for
	the expenses of myself and master; but before the end of the year, all our
	money went away in the smoke of our furnaces. My master, at the same time,
	died of a fever, brought on by the parching heat of our laboratory, from
	which he seldom or never stirred, and which was scarcely less hot than the
	arsenal of Venice. His death was the more unfortunate for me, as my
	parents took the opportunity of reducing my allowance, and sending me only
	sufficient for my board and lodging, instead of the sum I required to
	continue my operations in alchymy.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“To meet this difficulty and get out of leading-strings, I returned home
		at the age of twenty-five, and mortgaged part of my property for four
		hundred crowns. This sum was necessary to perform an operation of the
		science, which had been communicated to me by an <a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"></a>Italian at Toulouse, and
		who, as he said, had proved its efficacy. I retained this man in my
		service, that we might see the end of the experiment. I then, by means of
		strong distillations, tried to calcinate gold and silver; but all my
		labour was in vain. The weight of the gold I drew out of my furnace was
		diminished by one-half since I put it in, and my four hundred crowns were
		very soon reduced to two hundred and thirty. I gave twenty of these to my
		Italian, in order that he might travel to Milan, where the author of the
		receipt resided, and ask him the explanation of some passages which we
		thought obscure. I remained at Toulouse all the winter, in the hope of his
		return; but I might have remained there till this day if I had waited for
		him, for I never saw his face again.</p>

		<p>“In the succeeding summer there was a great plague, which forced me to
		quit the town. I did not, however, lose sight of my work. I went to
		Cahors, where I remained six months, and made the acquaintance of an old
		man, who was commonly known to the people as ‘the Philosopher;’ a name
		which, in country places, is often bestowed upon people whose only merit
		is, that they are less ignorant than their neighbours. I shewed him my
		collection of alchymical receipts, and asked his opinion upon them. He
		picked out ten or twelve of them, merely saying that they were better than
		the others. When the plague ceased, I returned to Toulouse, and
		recommenced my experiments in search of the stone. I worked to such effect
		that my four hundred crowns were reduced to one hundred and seventy.</p>

		<p>“That I might continue my work on a safer method, I made acquaintance, in
		1537, with a certain abbé who resided in the neighbourhood. He was smitten
		with the same mania as myself, and told me that one of his friends, who
		had followed to Rome in the retinue of the Cardinal d’Armagnac, had sent
		him from that city a new receipt which could not fail to transmute iron
		and copper, but which would cost two hundred crowns. I provided half this
		money, and the abbé the rest; and we began to operate at our joint
		expense. As we required spirits of wine for our experiment, I bought a tun
		of excellent <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de Gaillac</em>. I extracted the spirit, and rectified it
		several times. We took a quantity of this, into which we put four marks of
		silver and one of gold that had been undergoing the process of calcination
		for a month. We put this mixture cleverly into a sort of horn-shaped
		vessel, with another to serve as a retort; and placed the whole apparatus
		upon our furnace to produce congelation. This experiment lasted a year;
		but, not to remain idle, we amused ourselves with many other less
		important operations. We drew quite as much profit from these as from our
		great work.</p>

		<p>“The whole of the year 1537 passed over without producing any <a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"></a>change
		whatever; in fact we might have waited till doomsday for the congelation
		of our spirits of wine. However, we made a projection with it upon some
		heated quicksilver; but all was in vain. Judge of our chagrin, especially
		of that of the abbé, who had already boasted to all the monks of his
		monastery, that they had only to bring the large pump which stood in a
		corner of the cloister, and he would convert it into gold: but this ill
		luck did not prevent us from persevering. I once more mortgaged my
		paternal lands for four hundred crowns, the whole of which I determined to
		devote to a renewal of my search for the great secret. The abbé
		contributed the same sum; and with these eight hundred crowns I proceeded
		to Paris, a city more abounding with alchymists than any other in the
		world, resolved never to leave it until I had either found the
		philosopher’s stone or spent all my money. This journey gave the greatest
		offence to all my relations and friends, who, imagining that I was fitted
		to be a great lawyer, were anxious that I should establish myself in that
		profession. For the sake of quietness, I pretended, at last, that such was
		my object.</p>

		<p>“After travelling for fifteen days, I arrived in Paris on the 9th of
		January 1539. I remained for a month almost unknown; but I had no sooner
		begun to frequent the amateurs of the science, and visited the shops of
		the furnace-makers, than I had the acquaintance of more than a hundred
		operative alchymists, each of whom had a different theory and a different
		mode of working. Some of them preferred cementation; others sought the
		universal alkahest or dissolvent; and some of them boasted the great
		efficacy of the essence of emery. Some of them endeavoured to extract
		mercury from other metals, to fix it afterwards; and, in order that each
		of us should be thoroughly acquainted with the proceedings of the others,
		we agreed to meet somewhere every night and report progress. We met
		sometimes at the house of one, and sometimes in the garret of another; not
		only on week days, but on Sundays and the great festivals of the Church.
		‘Ah!’ one used to say, ‘if I had the means of recommencing this
		experiment, I should do something.’ ‘Yes,’ said another, ‘if my crucible
		had not cracked, I should have succeeded before now;’ while a third
		exclaimed, with a sigh, ‘If I had but had a round copper vessel of
		sufficient strength, I would have fixed mercury with silver.’ There was
		not one among them who had not some excuse for his failure; but I was deaf
		to all their speeches. I did not want to part with my money to any of
		them, remembering how often I had been the dupe of such promises.</p>

		<p>“A Greek at last presented himself; and with him I worked a long time
		uselessly upon nails made of cinnabar or vermilion. I was <a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"></a>also acquainted
		with a foreign gentleman newly arrived in Paris, and often accompanied him
		to the shops of the goldsmiths to sell pieces of gold and silver, the
		produce, as he said, of his experiments. I stuck closely to him for a long
		time, in the hope that he would impart his secret. He refused for a long
		time, but acceded at last on my earnest entreaty, and I found that it was
		nothing more than an ingenious trick. I did not fail to inform my friend
		the abbé, whom I had left at Toulouse, of all my adventures; and sent him,
		among other matters, a relation of the trick by which this gentleman
		pretended to turn lead into gold. The abbé still imagined that I should
		succeed at last, and advised me to remain another year in Paris, where I
		had made so good a beginning. I remained there three years; but,
		notwithstanding all my efforts, I had no more success than I had had
		elsewhere.</p>

		<p>“I had just got to the end of my money, when I received a letter from the
		abbé, telling me to leave every thing, and join him immediately at
		Toulouse. I went accordingly, and found that he had received letters from
		the king of Navarre (grandfather of Henry IV.). This prince was a great
		lover of philosophy, full of curiosity, and had written to the abbé that I
		should visit him at Pau; and that he would give me three or four thousand
		crowns if I would communicate the secret I had learned from the foreign
		gentleman. The abbé’s ears were so tickled with the four thousand crowns,
		that he let me have no peace night or day until he had fairly seen me on
		the road to Pau. I arrived at that place in the month of May 1542. I
		worked away, and succeeded, according to the receipt I had obtained. When
		I had finished to the satisfaction of the king, he gave me the reward that
		I expected. Although he was willing enough to do me further service, he
		was dissuaded from it by the lords of his court; even by many of those who
		had been most anxious that I should come. He sent me then about my
		business, with many thanks; saying, that if there was any thing in his
		kingdom which he could give me—such as the produce of confiscations or
		the like—he should be most happy. I thought I might stay long enough for
		these prospective confiscations, and never get them at last; and I
		therefore determined to go back to my friend the abbé.</p>

		<p>“I learned that, on the road between Pau and Toulouse, there resided a
		monk who was very skilful in all matters of natural philosophy. On my
		return, I paid him a visit. He pitied me very much, and advised me, with
		much warmth and kindness of expression, not to amuse myself any longer
		with such experiments as these, which were all false and sophistical; but
		that I should read the good books of the old philosophers, where I might
		not only find the true matter <a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"></a>of the science of alchymy, but learn also
		the exact order of operations which ought to be followed. I very much
		approved of this wise advice; but before I acted upon it, I went back to
		my abbé of Toulouse, to give him an account of the eight hundred crowns
		which we had had in common, and, at the same time, share with him such
		reward as I had received from the king of Navarre. If he was little
		satisfied with the relation of my adventures since our first separation,
		he appeared still less satisfied when I told him I had formed a resolution
		to renounce the search for the philosopher’s stone. The reason was that he
		thought me a good artist. Of our eight hundred crowns, there remained but
		one hundred and seventy-six. When I quitted the abbé, I went to my own
		house with the intention of remaining there, till I had read all the old
		philosophers, and of then proceeding to Paris.</p>

		<p>“I arrived in Paris on the day after All Saints, of the year 1546, and
		devoted another year to the assiduous study of great authors. Among
		others, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turba Philosophorum</cite> of the Good Trevisan, the <cite>Remonstrance
		of Nature to the Wandering Alchymist</cite>, by Jean de Meung, and several
		others of the best books; but, as I had no right principles, I did not
		well know what course to follow.</p>

		<p>“At last I left my solitude, not to see my former acquaintances, the
		adepts and operators, but to frequent the society of true philosophers.
		Among them I fell into still greater uncertainties; being, in fact,
		completely bewildered by the variety of operations which they shewed me.
		Spurred on, nevertheless, by a sort of frenzy or inspiration, I threw
		myself into the works of Raymond Lulli and of Arnold de Villeneuve. The
		reading of these, and the reflections I made upon them, occupied me for
		another year, when I finally determined on the course I should adopt. I
		was obliged to wait, however, until I had mortgaged another very
		considerable portion of my patrimony. This business was not settled until
		the beginning of Lent, 1549, when I commenced my operations. I laid in a
		stock of all that was necessary, and began to work the day after Easter.
		It was not, however, without some disquietude and opposition from my
		friends who came about me; one asking me what I was going to do, and
		whether I had not already spent money enough upon such follies? Another
		assured me that, if I bought so much charcoal, I should strengthen the
		suspicion already existing, that I was a coiner of base money. Another
		advised me to purchase some place in the magistracy, as I was already a
		Doctor of Laws. My relations spoke in terms still more annoying to me, and
		even threatened that, if I continued to make such a fool of myself, they
		would send a posse of police-officers into my house, and break all my
		furnaces and crucibles into atoms. I was wearied <a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"></a>almost to death by this
		continued persecution; but I found comfort in my work and in the progress
		of my experiment, to which I was very attentive, and which went on bravely
		from day to day. About this time, there was a dreadful plague in Paris,
		which interrupted all intercourse between man and man, and left me as much
		to myself as I could desire. I soon had the satisfaction to remark the
		progress and succession of the three colours which, according to the
		philosophers, always prognosticate the approaching perfection of the work.
		I observed them distinctly, one after the other; and next year, being
		Easter Sunday, 1550, I made the great trial. Some common quicksilver,
		which I put into a small crucible on the fire, was, in less than an hour,
		converted into very good gold. You may judge how great was my joy, but I
		took care not to boast of it. I returned thanks to God for the favour he
		had shewn me, and prayed that I might only be permitted to make such use
		of it as would redound to his glory.</p>

		<p>“On the following day, I went towards Toulouse to find, the abbé, in
		accordance with a mutual promise, that we should communicate our
		discoveries to each other. On my way, I called in to see the sage monk who
		had assisted me with his counsels; but I had the sorrow to learn that they
		were both dead. After this, I would not return to my own home, but retired
		to another place, to await one of my relations whom I had left in charge
		of my estate. I gave him orders to sell all that belonged to me, as well
		movable as immovable—to pay my debts with the proceeds, and divide all
		the rest among those in any way related to me who might stand in need of
		it, in order that they might enjoy some share of the good fortune which
		had befallen me. There was a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood about
		my precipitate retreat; the wisest of my acquaintance imagining that,
		broken down and ruined by my mad expenses, I sold my little remaining
		property, that I might go and hide my shame in distant countries.</p>

		<p>“My relative already spoken of rejoined me on the 1st of July, after
		having performed all the business I had entrusted him with. We took our
		departure together, to seek a land of liberty. We first retired to
		Lausanne, in Switzerland, when, after remaining there for some time, we
		resolved to pass the remainder of our days in some of the most celebrated
		cities of Germany, living quietly and without splendour.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Thus ends the story of Denis Zachaire, as written by himself. He has not
	been so candid at its conclusion as at its commencement, and has left the
	world in doubt as to his real motives for pretending that he had
	discovered the philosopher’s stone. It seems probable that the sentence he
	puts into the mouths of his wisest acquaintances was <a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"></a>the true reason of
	his retreat; that he was, in fact, reduced to poverty, and hid his shame
	in foreign countries. Nothing further is known of his life, and his real
	name has never yet been discovered. He wrote a work on alchymy, entitled
	<cite>The true Natural Philosophy of Metals</cite>.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Dr. Dee and Edward Kelly.</h3>

	<p>John Dee and Edward Kelly claim to be mentioned together, having been so
	long associated in the same pursuits, and undergone so many strange
	vicissitudes in each other’s society. Dee was altogether a wonderful man,
	and had he lived in an age when folly and superstition were less rife, he
	would, with the same powers which he enjoyed, have left behind him a
	bright and enduring reputation. He was born in London in the year 1527,
	and very early manifested a love for study. At the age of fifteen he was
	sent to Cambridge, and delighted so much in his books, that he passed
	regularly eighteen hours every day among them. Of the other six, he
	devoted four to sleep and two for refreshment. Such intense application
	did not injure his health, and could not fail to make him one of the first
	scholars of his time. Unfortunately, however, he quitted the mathematics
	and the pursuits of true philosophy, to indulge in the unprofitable
	reveries of the occult sciences. He studied alchymy, astrology, and magic,
	and thereby rendered himself obnoxious to the authorities at Cambridge. To
	avoid persecution, he was at last obliged to retire to the university of
	Louvain; the rumours of sorcery that were current respecting him rendering
	his longer stay in England not altogether without danger. He found at
	Louvain many kindred spirits who had known Cornelius Agrippa while he
	resided among them, and by whom he was constantly entertained with the
	wondrous deeds of that great master of the hermetic mysteries. From their
	conversation he received much encouragement to continue the search for the
	philosopher’s stone, which soon began to occupy nearly all his thoughts.</p>

	</div>

	<p>He did not long remain on the Continent, but returned to England in 1551,
	being at that time in the twenty-fourth year of his age. By the influence
	of his friend Sir John Cheek, he was kindly received at the court of King
	Edward VI., and rewarded (it is difficult to say for what) with a pension
	of one hundred crowns. He continued for several years to practise in
	London as an astrologer; casting nativities, telling fortunes, and
	pointing out lucky and unlucky days. <a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"></a>During the reign of Queen Mary he got
	into trouble, being suspected of heresy, and charged with attempting
	Mary’s life by means of enchantments. He was tried for the latter offence,
	and acquitted; but was retained in prison on the former charge, and left
	to the tender mercies of Bishop Bonner. He had a very narrow escape from
	being burned in Smithfield, but he somehow or other contrived to persuade
	that fierce bigot that his orthodoxy was unimpeachable, and was set at
	liberty in 1555.</p>

	<p>On the accession of Elizabeth, a brighter day dawned upon him. During her
	retirement at Woodstock, her servants appear to have consulted him as to
	the time of Mary’s death, which circumstance no doubt first gave rise to
	the serious charge for which he was brought to trial. They now came to
	consult him more openly as to the fortunes of their mistress; and Robert
	Dudley, the celebrated Earl of Leicester, was sent by command of the Queen
	herself to know the most auspicious day for her coronation. So great was
	the favour he enjoyed, that, some years afterwards, Elizabeth condescended
	to pay him a visit at his house in Mortlake, to view his museum of
	curiosities, and when he was ill, sent her own physician to attend upon
	him.</p>

	<p>Astrology was the means whereby he lived, and he continued to practise it
	with great assiduity; but his heart was in alchymy. The philosopher’s
	stone and the elixir of life haunted his daily thoughts and his nightly
	dreams. The Talmudic mysteries, which he had also deeply studied,
	impressed him with the belief, that he might hold converse with spirits
	and angels, and learn from them all the mysteries of the universe. Holding
	the same idea as the then obscure sect of the Rosicrucians, some of whom
	he had perhaps encountered in his travels in Germany, he imagined that, by
	means of the philosopher’s stone, he could summon these kindly spirits at
	his will. By dint of continually brooding upon the subject, his
	imagination became so diseased, that he at last persuaded himself that an
	angel appeared to him, and promised to be his friend and companion as long
	as he lived. He relates that, one day, in November 1582, while he was
	engaged in fervent prayer, the window of his museum looking towards the
	west suddenly glowed with a dazzling light, in the midst of which, in all
	his glory, stood the great angel Uriel. Awe and wonder rendered him
	speechless; but the angel smiling graciously upon him, gave him a crystal,
	of a convex form, and told him that whenever he wished to hold converse
	with the beings of another sphere, he had only to gaze intently upon it,
	and they would appear in the crystal, and unveil to him all the secrets of
	futurity.<a href="#fn41" id="fnm41" title="The 'crystal' alluded to..." class="fnmarker">41</a> Thus saying, the angel disappeared. <a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"></a>Dee found from
	experience of the crystal that it was necessary that all the faculties of
	the soul should be concentrated upon it, otherwise the spirits did not
	appear. He also found that he could never recollect the conversations he
	had with the angels. He therefore determined to communicate the secret to
	another person, who might converse with the spirit while he (Dee) sat in
	another part of the room, and took down in writing the revelations which
	they made.</p>

	</div>

	<p>He had at this time in his service, as his assistant, one Edward Kelly,
	who, like himself, was crazy upon the subject of the philosopher’s stone.
	There was this difference, however, between them, that, while Dee was more
	of an enthusiast than an impostor, Kelly was more of an impostor than an
	enthusiast. In early life he was a notary, and had the misfortune to lose
	both his ears for forgery. This mutilation, degrading enough in any man,
	was destructive to a philosopher; Kelly, therefore, lest his wisdom should
	suffer in the world’s opinion, wore a black skull-cap, which, fitting
	close to his head, and descending over both his cheeks, not only concealed
	his loss, but gave him a very solemn and oracular appearance. So well did
	he keep his secret, that even Dee, with whom he lived so many years,
	appears never to have discovered it. Kelly, with this character, was just
	the man to carry on any piece of roguery for his own advantage, or to
	nurture the delusions of his master for the same purpose. No sooner did
	Dee inform him of the visit he had received from the glorious Uriel, than
	Kelly expressed such a fervour of belief, that Dee’s heart glowed with
	delight. He set about consulting his crystal forthwith, <a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"></a>and on the 2d of
	December, 1581, the spirits appeared, and held a very extraordinary
	discourse with Kelly, which Dee took down in writing. The curious reader
	may see this farrago of nonsense among the Harleian Mss. in the British
	Museum. The later consultations were published in a folio volume, in 1659,
	by Dr. Meric Casaubon, under the title of <cite>A true and faithful Relation of
	what passed between Dr. John Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it
	succeeded, to a general Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in the
	World</cite>.<a href="#fn42" id="fnm42" title="Lilly the astrologer..." class="fnmarker">42</a></p>

	<p>The fame of these wondrous colloquies soon spread over the country, and
	even reached the Continent. Dee at the same time pretended to be in
	possession of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>, which he stated he had found among the
	ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, in Somersetshire. People flocked from far and
	near to his house at Mortlake to have their nativities cast, in preference
	to visiting astrologers of less renown. They also longed to see a man who,
	according to his own account, would never die. Altogether, he carried on a
	very profitable trade, but spent so much in drugs and metals to work out
	some peculiar process of transmutation, that he never became rich.</p>

	<p>About this time there came into England a wealthy polish nobleman, named
	Albert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradz. His object was principally, he
	said, to visit the court of Queen Elizabeth, the fame of whose glory and
	magnificence had reached him in distant Poland. Elizabeth received this
	flattering stranger with the most splendid hospitality, and appointed her
	favourite Leicester to shew him all that was worth seeing in England. He
	visited all the curiosities of London and Westminster, and from thence
	proceeded to Oxford and Cambridge, that he might converse with some of the
	great scholars whose writings shed lustre upon the land of their birth. He
	was very much disappointed at not finding Dr. Dee among them, and told the
	Earl of Leicester that he would not have gone to Oxford if he had known
	that Dee was not there. The earl promised to introduce him to the great
	alchymist on their return to London, and the Pole was satisfied. A few
	days afterwards, the earl and Laski being in the antechamber of the Queen,
	awaiting an audience of her majesty, Dr. Dee arrived on the same errand,
	and was introduced to the Pole.<a href="#fn43" id="fnm43" title="Albert Laski..." class="fnmarker">43</a> An interesting <a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"></a>conversation ensued,
	which ended by the stranger inviting himself to dine with the astrologer
	at his house at Mortlake. Dee returned home in some tribulation, for he
	found he had not money enough, without pawning his plate, to entertain
	Count Laski and his retinue in a manner becoming their dignity. In this
	emergency he sent off an express to the Earl of Leicester, stating frankly
	the embarrassment he laboured under, and praying his good offices in
	representing the matter to her majesty. Elizabeth immediately sent him a
	present of twenty pounds.</p>

	<p>On the appointed day Count Laski came, attended by a numerous retinue, and
	expressed such open and warm admiration of the wonderful attainments of
	his host, that Dee turned over in his own mind how he could bind
	irretrievably to his interests a man who seemed so well inclined to become
	his friend. Long acquaintance with Kelly had imbued him with all the
	roguery of that personage, and he resolved to make the Pole pay dearly for
	his dinner. He found out before many days that he possessed great estates
	in his own country, as well as great influence, but that an extravagant
	disposition had reduced him to temporary embarrassment. He also discovered
	that he was a firm believer in the philosopher’s stone and the water of
	life. He was therefore just the man upon whom an adventurer might fasten
	himself. Kelly thought so too; and both of them set to work to weave a
	web, in the meshes of which they might firmly entangle the rich and
	credulous stranger. They went very cautiously about it; first throwing out
	obscure hints of the stone and the elixir, and finally of the spirits, by
	means of whom they could turn over the pages of the book of futurity, and
	read the awful secrets inscribed therein. Laski eagerly implored that he
	might be admitted to one of their mysterious interviews with Uriel and the
	angels; but they knew human nature too well to accede at once to the
	request. To the count’s entreaties they only replied by hints of the
	difficulty or impropriety of summoning the spirits in the presence of a
	stranger, or of one who might perchance have no other motive than the
	gratification of a vain curiosity; but they only meant to whet the edge of
	his appetite by this delay, and would have been sorry indeed if the count
	had been discouraged. To shew how exclusively the thoughts both of Dee and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"></a>Kelly were fixed upon their dupe at this time, it is only necessary to
	read the introduction to their first interview with the spirits, related
	in the volume of Dr. Casaubon. The entry made by Dee, under the date of
	the 25th of May, 1583, says, that when the spirit appeared to them, “I
	[John Dee] and E.&nbsp;K. [Edward Kelly] sat together, conversing of that noble
	Polonian Albertus Laski, his great honour here with us obtained, and of
	his great liking among all sorts of the people.” No doubt they were
	discussing how they might make the most of the “noble Polonian,” and
	concocting the fine story with which they afterwards excited his
	curiosity, and drew him firmly within their toils. “Suddenly,” says Dee,
	as they were thus employed, “there seemed to come out of the oratory a
	spiritual creature, like a pretty girl of seven or nine years of age,
	attired on her head, with her hair rolled up before and hanging down
	behind, with a gown of silk, of changeable red and green, and with a
	train. She seemed to play up and down, and seemed to go in and out behind
	the books; and as she seemed to go between them, the books displaced
	themselves, and made way for her.”</p>

	<p>With such tales as these they lured on the Pole from day to day, and at
	last persuaded him to be a witness of their mysteries. Whether they played
	off any optical delusions upon him, or whether, by the force of a strong
	imagination, he deluded himself, does not appear, but certain it is that
	he became a complete tool in their hands, and consented to do whatever
	they wished him. Kelly, at these interviews, placed himself at a certain
	distance from the wondrous crystal, and gazed intently upon it, while Dee
	took his place in a corner, ready to set down the prophecies as they were
	uttered by the spirits. In this manner they prophesied to the Pole that he
	should become the fortunate possessor of the philosopher’s stone; that he
	should live for centuries, and be chosen King of Poland, in which capacity
	he should gain many great victories over the Saracens, and make his name
	illustrious over all the earth. For this purpose it was necessary,
	however, that Laski should leave England, and take them with him, together
	with their wives and families; that he should treat them all sumptuously,
	and allow them to want for nothing. Laski at once consented; and very
	shortly afterwards they were all on the road to Poland.</p>

	<p>It took them upwards of four months to reach the count’s estates in the
	neighbourhood of Cracow. In the mean time, they led a pleasant life, and
	spent money with an unsparing hand. When once established in the count’s
	palace, they commenced the great hermetic operation of transmuting iron
	into gold. Laski provided them with all necessary materials, and aided
	them himself with his knowledge of alchymy; but, somehow or other, the
	experiment always failed at <a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"></a>the very moment it ought to have succeeded,
	and they were obliged to recommence operations on a grander scale. But the
	hopes of Laski were not easily extinguished. Already, in idea, the
	possessor of countless millions, he was not to be cast down for fear of
	present expenses. He thus continued from day to day, and from month to
	month, till he was at last obliged to sell a portion of his
	deeply-mortgaged estates to find aliment for the hungry crucibles of Dee
	and Kelly, and the no less hungry stomachs of their wives and families. It
	was not till ruin stared him in the face that he awoke from his dream of
	infatuation, too happy, even then, to find that he had escaped utter
	beggary. Thus restored to his senses, his first thought was how to rid
	himself of his expensive visitors. Not wishing to quarrel with them, he
	proposed that they should proceed to Prague, well furnished with letters
	of recommendation to the Emperor Rudolph. Our alchymists too plainly saw
	that nothing more was to be made of the almost destitute Count Laski.
	Without hesitation, therefore, they accepted the proposal, and set out
	forthwith to the imperial residence. They had no difficulty, on their
	arrival at Prague, in obtaining an audience of the emperor. They found him
	willing enough to believe that such a thing as the philosopher’s stone
	existed, and flattered themselves that they had made a favourable
	impression upon him; but, from some cause or other—perhaps the look of
	low cunning and quackery upon the face of Kelly—the emperor conceived no
	very high opinion of their abilities. He allowed them, however, to remain
	for some months at Prague, feeding themselves upon the hope that he would
	employ them; but the more he saw of them, the less he liked them; and,
	when the pope’s nuncio represented to him that he ought not to countenance
	such heretic magicians, he gave orders that they should quit his dominions
	within four-and-twenty hours. It was fortunate for them that so little
	time was given them; for, had they remained six hours longer, the nuncio
	had received orders to procure a perpetual dungeon or the stake for them.</p>

	<p>Not knowing well whither to direct their steps, they resolved to return to
	Cracow, where they had still a few friends; but, by this time, the funds
	they had drawn from Laski were almost exhausted, and they were many days
	obliged to go dinnerless and supperless. They had great difficulty to keep
	their poverty a secret from the world; but they managed to bear privation
	without murmuring, from a conviction that if the fact were known, it would
	militate very much against their pretensions. Nobody would believe that
	they were possessors of the philosopher’s stone, if it were once suspected
	that they did not know how to procure bread for their subsistence. They
	still gained a little by casting nativities, and kept starvation at arm’s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"></a>length, till a new dupe, rich enough for their purposes, dropped into
	their toils, in the shape of a royal personage. Having procured an
	introduction to Stephen king of Poland, they predicted to him that the
	Emperor Rudolph would shortly be assassinated, and that the Germans would
	look to Poland for his successor. As this prediction was not precise
	enough to satisfy the king, they tried their crystal again, and a spirit
	appeared who told them that the new sovereign of Germany would be Stephen
	of Poland. Stephen was credulous enough to believe them, and was once
	present when Kelly held his mystic conversations with the shadows of his
	crystal. He also appears to have furnished them with money to carry on
	their experiments in alchymy; but he grew tired, at last, of their broken
	promises and their constant drains upon his pocket, and was on the point
	of discarding them with disgrace, when they met with another dupe, to whom
	they eagerly transferred their services. This was Count Rosenberg, a
	nobleman of large estates at Trebona in Bohemia. So comfortable did they
	find themselves in the palace of this munificent patron, that they
	remained nearly four years with him, faring sumptuously, and having an
	almost unlimited command of his money. The count was more ambitious than
	avaricious: he had wealth enough, and did not care for the philosopher’s
	stone on account of the gold, but of the length of days it would bring
	him. They had their predictions, accordingly, all ready framed to suit his
	character. They prophesied that he should be chosen king of Poland; and
	promised, moreover, that he should live for five hundred years to enjoy
	his dignity, provided always that he found them sufficient money to carry
	on their experiments.</p>

	<p>But now, while fortune smiled upon them, while they revelled in the
	rewards of successful villany, retributive justice came upon them in a
	shape they had not anticipated. Jealousy and mistrust sprang up between
	the two confederates, and led to such violent and frequent quarrels, that
	Dee was in constant fear of exposure. Kelly imagined himself a much
	greater personage than Dee; measuring, most likely, by the standard of
	impudent roguery; and was displeased that on all occasions, and from all
	persons, Dee received the greater share of honour and consideration. He
	often threatened to leave Dee to shift for himself; and the latter, who
	had degenerated into the mere tool of his more daring associate, was
	distressed beyond measure at the prospect of his desertion. His mind was
	so deeply imbued with superstition, that he believed the rhapsodies of
	Kelly to be, in a great measure, derived from his intercourse with angels;
	and he knew not where, in the whole world, to look for a man of depth and
	wisdom enough to succeed him. As their quarrels every day became more <a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"></a>and
	more frequent, Dee wrote letters to Queen Elizabeth to secure a favourable
	reception on his return to England, whither he intended to proceed if
	Kelly forsook him. He also sent her a round piece of silver, which he
	pretended he had made of a portion of brass cut out of a warming-pan. He
	afterwards sent her the warming-pan also, that she might convince herself
	that the piece of silver corresponded exactly with the hole which was cut
	into the brass. While thus preparing for the worst, his chief desire was
	to remain in Bohemia with Count Rosenberg, who treated him well, and
	reposed much confidence in him. Neither had Kelly any great objection to
	remain; but a new passion had taken possession of his breast, and he was
	laying deep schemes to gratify it. His own wife was ill-favoured and
	ill-natured; Dee’s was comely and agreeable; and he longed to make an
	exchange of partners without exciting the jealousy or shocking the
	morality of Dee. This was a difficult matter; but to a man like Kelly, who
	was as deficient in rectitude and right feeling as he was full of
	impudence and ingenuity, the difficulty was not insurmountable. He had
	also deeply studied the character and the foibles of Dee; and he took his
	measures accordingly. The next time they consulted the spirits, Kelly
	pretended to be shocked at their language, and refused to tell Dee what
	they had said. Dee insisted, and was informed that they were henceforth to
	have their wives in common. Dee, a little startled, inquired whether the
	spirits might not mean that they were to live in common harmony and
	good-will? Kelly tried again, with apparent reluctance, and said the
	spirits insisted upon the literal interpretation. The poor fanatic Dee
	resigned himself to their will; but it suited Kelly’s purpose to appear
	coy a little longer. He declared that the spirits must be spirits not of
	good, but of evil; and refused to consult them any more. He thereupon took
	his departure, saying that he would never return.</p>

	<p>Dee, thus left to himself, was in sore trouble and distress of mind. He
	knew not on whom to fix as the successor to Kelly for consulting the
	spirits; but at last chose his son Arthur, a boy of eight years of age. He
	consecrated him to this service with great ceremony, and impressed upon
	the child’s mind the dignified and awful nature of the duties he was
	called upon to perform; but the poor boy had neither the imagination, the
	faith, nor the artifice of Kelly. He looked intently upon the crystal as
	he was told; but could see nothing and hear nothing. At last, when his
	eyes ached, he said he could see a vague indistinct shadow, but nothing
	more. Dee was in despair. The deception had been carried on so long, that
	he was never so happy as when he fancied he was holding converse with
	superior beings; and he cursed the day that had put estrangement between
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"></a>him and his dear friend Kelly. This was exactly what Kelly had foreseen;
	and, when he thought the doctor had grieved sufficiently for his absence,
	he returned unexpectedly, and entered the room where the little Arthur was
	in vain endeavouring to distinguish something in the crystal. Dee, in
	entering this circumstance in his journal, ascribes this sudden return to
	a “miraculous fortune” and a “divine fate;” and goes on to record that
	Kelly immediately saw the spirits which had remained invisible to little
	Arthur. One of these spirits reiterated the previous command, that they
	should have their wives in common. Kelly bowed his head and submitted; and
	Dee, in all humility, consented to the arrangement.</p>

	<p>This was the extreme depth of the wretched man’s degradation. In this
	manner they continued to live for three or four months, when, new quarrels
	breaking out, they separated once more. This time their separation was
	final. Kelly, taking the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir</em> which he had found in Glastonbury Abbey,
	proceeded to Prague, forgetful of the abrupt mode in which he had
	previously been expelled from that city. Almost immediately after his
	arrival, he was seized by order of the Emperor Rudolph, and thrown into
	prison. He was released after some months’ confinement, and continued for
	five years to lead a vagabond life in Germany, telling fortunes at one
	place, and pretending to make gold at another. He was a second time thrown
	into prison, on a charge of heresy and sorcery; and he then resolved, if
	ever he obtained his liberty, to return to England. He soon discovered
	that there was no prospect of this, and that his imprisonment was likely
	to be for life. He twisted his bed-clothes into a rope, one stormy night
	in February 1595, and let himself down from the window of his dungeon,
	situated at the top of a very high tower. Being a corpulent man, the rope
	gave way, and he was precipitated to the ground. He broke two of his ribs
	and both his legs; and was otherwise so much injured, that he expired a
	few days afterwards.</p>

	<p>Dee, for a while, had more prosperous fortune. The warming-pan he had sent
	to Queen Elizabeth was not without effect. He was rewarded soon after
	Kelly had left him with an invitation to return to England. His pride,
	which had been sorely humbled, sprang up again to its pristine dimensions,
	and he set out from Bohemia with a train of attendants becoming an
	ambassador. How he procured the money does not appear, unless from the
	liberality of the rich Bohemian Rosenberg, or perhaps from his plunder. He
	travelled with three coaches for himself and family, and three wagons to
	carry his baggage. Each coach had four horses, and the whole train was
	protected by a guard of four and twenty soldiers. This statement may be
	doubted; but it is on the authority of Dee himself, who made it on <a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"></a>oath
	before the commissioners appointed by Elizabeth to inquire into his
	circumstances. On his arrival in England he had an audience of the queen,
	who received him kindly as far as words went, and gave orders that he
	should not be molested in his pursuits of chemistry and philosophy. A man
	who boasted of the power to turn baser metals into gold, could not,
	thought Elizabeth, be in want of money; and she therefore gave him no more
	substantial marks of her approbation than her countenance and protection.</p>

	<p>Thrown thus unexpectedly upon his own resources, Dee began in earnest the
	search for the philosopher’s stone. He worked incessantly among his
	furnaces, retorts, and crucibles, and almost poisoned himself with
	deleterious fumes. He also consulted his miraculous crystal; but the
	spirits appeared not to him. He tried one Bartholomew to supply the place
	of the invaluable Kelly; but he being a man of some little probity, and of
	no imagination at all, the spirits would not hold any communication with
	him. Dee then tried another pretender to philosophy, of the name of
	Hickman, but had no better fortune. The crystal had lost its power since
	the departure of its great high priest. From this quarter, then, Dee could
	get no information on the stone or elixir of the alchymists, and all his
	efforts to discover them by other means were not only fruitless but
	expensive. He was soon reduced to great distress, and wrote piteous
	letters to the queen praying relief. He represented that, after he left
	England with Count Laski, the mob had pillaged his house at Mortlake,
	accusing him of being a necromancer and a wizard; and had broken all his
	furniture, burned his library, consisting of four thousand rare volumes,
	and destroyed all the philosophical instruments and curiosities in his
	museum. For this damage he claimed compensation; and furthermore stated,
	that, as he had come to England by the queen’s command, she ought to pay
	the expenses of his journey. Elizabeth sent him small sums of money at
	various times; but Dee still continuing his complaints, a commission was
	appointed to inquire into his circumstances. He finally obtained a small
	appointment as Chancellor of St. Paul’s cathedral, which he exchanged, in
	1595, for the wardenship of the college at Manchester. He remained in this
	capacity till 1602 or 1603, when, his strength and intellect beginning to
	fail him, he was compelled to resign. He retired to his old dwelling at
	Mortlake, in a state not far removed from actual want, supporting himself
	as a common fortune-teller, and being often obliged to sell or pawn his
	books to procure a dinner. James I. was often applied to on his behalf,
	but he refused to do any thing for him. It may be said to the discredit of
	this king, that the only reward he would grant the indefatigable Stowe, in
	his days of old age and want, was the royal permission <a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"></a>to beg; but no one
	will blame him for neglecting such a quack as John Dee. He died in 1608,
	in the eighty-first year of his age, and was buried at Mortlake.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">The Cosmopolite.</h3>

	<p>Many disputes have arisen as to the real name of the alchymist who wrote
	several works under the above designation. The general opinion is that he
	was a Scotsman named Seton, and that by a fate very common to alchymists
	who boasted too loudly of their powers of transmutation, he ended his days
	miserably in a dungeon, into which he was thrown by a German potentate
	until he made a million of gold to pay his ransom. By some he has been
	confounded with Michael Sendivog, or Sendivogius, a Pole, a professor of
	the same art, who made a great noise in Europe at the commencement of the
	seventeenth century. Lenglet du Fresnoy, who is in general well informed
	with respect to the alchymists, inclines to the belief that these
	personages were distinct; and gives the following particulars of the
	Cosmopolite, extracted from George Morhoff, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistola ad
	Langelottum</cite>, and other writers.</p>

	<p>About the year 1600, one Jacob Haussen, a Dutch pilot, was shipwrecked on
	the coast of Scotland. A gentleman, named Alexander Seton, put off in a
	boat, and saved him from drowning, and afterwards entertained him
	hospitably for many weeks at his house on the shore. Haussen saw that he
	was addicted to the pursuits of chemistry, but no conversation on the
	subject passed between them at the time. About a year and a half
	afterwards, Haussen being then at home at Enkhuysen, in Holland, received
	a visit from his former host. He endeavoured to repay the kindness that
	had been shewn him; and so great a friendship arose between them that
	Seton, on his departure, offered to make him acquainted with the great
	secret of the philosopher’s stone. In his presence the Scotsman transmuted
	a great quantity of base metal into pure gold, and gave it him as a mark
	of his esteem. Seton then took leave of his friend, and travelled into
	Germany. At Dresden he made no secret of his wonderful powers, having, it
	is said, performed transmutation successfully before a great assemblage of
	the learned men of that city. The circumstance coming to the ears of the
	Duke or Elector of Saxony, he gave orders for the arrest of the alchymist.
	He caused him to be imprisoned in a high tower, and set a guard of forty
	men to watch that he did not escape, and that no strangers were admitted
	to his presence. The unfortunate Seton received several visits from the
	elector, who used every art of persuasion to make him divulge his secret.
	Seton obstinately refused either to communicate his secret, <a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"></a>or to make any
	gold for the tyrant; on which he was stretched upon the rack, to see if
	the argument of torture would render him more tractable. The result was
	still the same; neither hope of reward nor fear of anguish could shake
	him. For several months he remained in prison, subjected alternately to a
	sedative and a violent regimen, till his health broke, and he wasted away
	almost to a skeleton.</p>

	<p>There happened at that time to be in Dresden a learned Pole, named Michael
	Sendivogius, who had wasted a good deal of his time and substance in the
	unprofitable pursuits of alchymy. He was touched with pity for the hard
	fate, and admiration for the intrepidity of Seton; and determined, if
	possible, to aid him in escaping from the clutch of his oppressor. He
	requested the elector’s permission to see the alchymist, and obtained it
	with some difficulty. He found him in a state of great wretchedness, shut
	up from the light of day in a noisome dungeon, and with no better couch or
	fare than those allotted to the worst of criminals. Seton listened eagerly
	to the proposal of escape, and promised the generous Pole that he would
	make him richer than an eastern monarch if by his means he were liberated.
	Sendivogius immediately commenced operations; he sold some property which
	he possessed near Cracow, and with the proceeds led a merry life at
	Dresden. He gave the most elegant suppers, to which he regularly invited
	the officers of the guard, and especially those who did duty at the prison
	of the alchymist. He insinuated himself at last into their confidence, and
	obtained free ingress to his friend as often as he pleased; pretending
	that he was using his utmost endeavours to conquer his obstinacy and worm
	his secret out of him. When their project was ripe, a day was fixed upon
	for the grand attempt; and Sendivogius was ready with a post-chariot to
	convey him with all speed into Poland. By drugging some wine which he
	presented to the guards of the prison, he rendered them so drowsy that he
	easily found means to scale a wall unobserved, with Seton, and effect his
	escape. Seton’s wife was in the chariot awaiting him, having safely in her
	possession a small packet of a black powder, which was, in fact, the
	philosopher’s stone, or ingredient for the transmutation of iron and
	copper into gold. They all arrived in safety at Cracow; but the frame of
	Seton was so wasted by torture of body and starvation, to say nothing of
	the anguish of mind he had endured, that he did not long survive. He died
	in Cracow, in 1603 or 1604, and was buried under the cathedral church of
	that city. Such is the story related of the author of the various works
	which bear the name of the Cosmopolite. A list of them may be found in the
	third volume of the <cite>History of the Hermetic Philosophy</cite>.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist"><a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"></a>Sendivogius.</h3>

	<p>On the death of Seton, Sendivogius married his widow, hoping to learn from
	her some of the secrets of her deceased lord in the art of transmutation.
	The ounce of black powder stood him, however, in better service; for the
	alchymists say, that by its means he converted great quantities of
	quicksilver into the purest gold. It is also said that he performed this
	experiment successfully before the Emperor Rudolph II., at Prague; and
	that the emperor, to commemorate the circumstance, caused a marble tablet
	to be affixed to the wall of the room in which it was performed, bearing
	this inscription, “Faciat hoc quispiam alius, quod fecit Sendivogius
	Polonus.” M. Desnoyers, secretary to the Princess Mary of Gonzaga, Queen
	of Poland, writing from Warsaw in 1651, says that he saw this tablet,
	which existed at that time, and was often visited by the curious.</p>

	<p>The after-life of Sendivogius is related in a Latin memoir of him by one
	Brodowski, his steward; and is inserted by Pierre Borel in his <cite>Treasure
	of Gaulish Antiquities</cite>. The Emperor Rudolph, according to this authority,
	was so well pleased with his success, that he made him one of his
	councillors of state, and invited him to fill a station in the royal
	household and inhabit the palace. But Sendivogius loved his liberty, and
	refused to become a courtier. He preferred to reside on his own
	patrimonial estate of Gravarna, where, for many years, he exercised a
	princely hospitality. His philosophic powder, which, his steward says, was
	red, and not black, he kept in a little box of gold; and with one grain of
	it he could make five hundred ducats, or a thousand rix-dollars. He
	generally made his projection upon quicksilver. When he travelled, he gave
	this box to his steward, who hung it round his neck by a gold chain next
	his skin. But the greatest part of the powder he used to hide in a secret
	place cut into the step of his chariot. He thought that, if attacked at
	any time by robbers, they would not search such a place as that. When he
	anticipated any danger, he would dress himself in his valet’s clothes,
	and, mounting the coach-box, put the valet inside. He was induced to take
	these precautions, because it was no secret that he possessed the
	philosopher’s stone; and many unprincipled adventurers were on the watch
	for an opportunity to plunder him. A German prince, whose name Brodowski
	has not thought fit to chronicle, served him a scurvy trick, which ever
	afterwards put him on his guard. This prince went on his knees to
	Sendivogius, and entreated him in the most pressing terms to satisfy his
	curiosity, by converting some quicksilver into gold before him.
	Sendivogius, wearied by his importunity, consented, upon a promise of
	inviolable <a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"></a>secrecy. After his departure, the prince called a German
	alchymist, named Muhlenfels, who resided in his house, and told him all
	that had been done. Muhlenfels entreated that he might have a dozen
	mounted horsemen at his command, that he might instantly ride after the
	philosopher, and either rob him of all his powder, or force from him the
	secret of making it. The prince desired nothing better; Muhlenfels, being
	provided with twelve men well mounted and armed, pursued Sendivogius in
	hot haste. He came up with him at a lonely inn by the road-side, just as
	he was sitting down to dinner. He at first endeavoured to persuade him to
	divulge the secret; but finding this of no avail, he caused his
	accomplices to strip the unfortunate Sendivogius and tie him naked to one
	of the pillars of the house. He then took from him his golden box,
	containing a small quantity of the powder; a manuscript book on the
	philosopher’s stone; a golden medal, with its chain, presented to him by
	the Emperor Rudolph; and a rich cap, ornamented with diamonds, of the
	value of one hundred thousand rix-dollars. With this booty he decamped,
	leaving Sendivogius still naked and firmly bound to the pillar. His
	servants had been treated in a similar manner; but the people of the inn
	released them all as soon as the robbers were out of sight.</p>

	<p>Sendivogius proceeded to Prague, and made his complaint to the emperor. An
	express was instantly sent off to the prince, with orders that he should
	deliver up Muhlenfels and all his plunder. The prince, fearful of the
	emperor’s wrath, caused three large gallows to be erected in his
	court-yard; on the highest of which he hanged Muhlenfels, with another
	thief on each side of him. He thus propitiated the emperor, and got rid of
	an ugly witness against himself. He sent back, at the same time, the
	bejewelled hat, the medal and chain, and the treatise upon the
	philosopher’s stone, which had been stolen from Sendivogius. As regarded
	the powder, he said he had not seen it, and knew nothing about it.</p>

	<p>This adventure made Sendivogius more prudent; he would no longer perform
	the process of transmutation before any strangers, however highly
	recommended. He pretended also to be very poor; and sometimes lay in bed
	for weeks together, that people might believe he was suffering from some
	dangerous malady, and could not therefore, by any possibility, be the
	owner of the philosopher’s stone. He would occasionally coin false money,
	and pass it off as gold; preferring to be esteemed a cheat rather than a
	successful alchymist.</p>

	<p>Many other extraordinary tales are told of this personage by his steward
	Brodowski, but they are not worth repeating. He died in 1636, aged upwards
	of eighty, and was buried in his own chapel at <a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"></a>Gravarna. Several works
	upon alchymy have been published under his name.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">The Rosicrucians.</h3>

	<p>It was during the time of the last-mentioned author that the sect of the
	Rosicrucians first began to create a sensation in Europe. The influence
	which they exercised upon opinion during their brief career, and the
	permanent impression which they have left upon European literature, claim
	for them especial notice. Before their time, alchymy was but a grovelling
	delusion; and theirs is the merit of having spiritualised and refined it.
	They also enlarged its sphere, and supposed the possession of the
	philosopher’s stone to be, not only the means of wealth, but of health and
	happiness, and the instrument by which man could command the services of
	superior beings, control the elements to his will, defy the obstructions
	of time and space, and acquire the most intimate knowledge of all the
	secrets of the universe. Wild and visionary as they were, they were not
	without their uses; if it were only for having purged the superstitions of
	Europe of the dark and disgusting forms with which the monks had peopled
	it, and substituted, in their stead, a race of mild, graceful, and
	beneficent beings.</p>

	<p>They are said to have derived their name from Christian Rosencreutz, or
	“Rose-cross,” a German philosopher, who travelled in the Holy Land towards
	the close of the fourteenth century. While dangerously ill at a place
	called Damcar, he was visited by some learned Arabs, who claimed him as
	their brother in science, and unfolded to him, by inspiration, all the
	secrets of his past life, both of thought and of action. They restored him
	to health by means of the philosopher’s stone, and afterwards instructed
	him in all their mysteries. He returned to Europe in 1401, being then only
	twenty-three years of age; and drew a chosen number of his friends around
	him, whom he initiated into the new science, and bound by solemn oaths to
	keep it secret for a century. He is said to have lived eighty-three years
	after this period, and to have died in 1484.</p>

	<p>Many have denied the existence of such a personage as Rosencreutz, and
	have fixed the origin of this sect at a much later epoch. The first
	dawning of it, they say, is to be found in the theories of Paracelsus and
	the dreams of Dr. Dee, who, without intending it, became the actual,
	though never the recognised founders of the Rosicrucian philosophy. It is
	now difficult, and indeed impossible, to determine whether Dee and
	Paracelsus obtained their ideas from the then obscure and unknown
	Rosicrucians, or whether the Rosicrucians did but follow and improve upon
	them. Certain it is, that their existence was never suspected till the
	year 1605, when they <a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"></a>began to excite attention in Germany. No sooner were
	their doctrines promulgated, than all the visionaries, Paracelsists, and
	alchymists, flocked around their standard, and vaunted Rosencreutz as the
	new regenerator of the human race. Michael Mayer, a celebrated physician
	of that day, and who had impaired his health and wasted his fortune in
	searching for the philosopher’s stone, drew up a report of the tenets and
	ordinances of the new fraternity, which was published at Cologne, in the
	year 1615. They asserted, in the first place, “that the meditations of
	their founders surpassed every thing that had ever been imagined since the
	creation of the world, without even excepting the revelations of the
	Deity; that they were destined to accomplish the general peace and
	regeneration of man before the end of the world arrived; that they
	possessed all wisdom and piety in a supreme degree; that they possessed
	all the graces of nature, and could distribute them among the rest of
	mankind according to their pleasure; that they were subject to neither
	hunger, nor thirst, nor disease, nor old age, nor to any other
	inconvenience of nature; that they knew by inspiration, and at the first
	glance, every one who was worthy to be admitted into their society; that
	they had the same knowledge then which they would have possessed if they
	had lived from the beginning of the world, and had been always acquiring
	it; that they had a volume in which they could read all that ever was or
	ever would be written in other books till the end of time; that they could
	force to, and retain in their service the most powerful spirits and
	demons; that, by the virtue of their songs, they could attract pearls and
	precious stones from the depths of the sea or the bowels of the earth;
	that God had covered them with a thick cloud, by means of which they could
	shelter themselves from the malignity of their enemies, and that they
	could thus render themselves invisible from all eyes; that the first eight
	brethren of the ‘Rose-cross’ had power to cure all maladies; that, by
	means of the fraternity, the triple diadem of the pope would be reduced
	into dust; that they only admitted two sacraments, with the ceremonies of
	the primitive Church, renewed by them; that they recognised the Fourth
	Monarchy and the Emperor of the Romans as their chief and the chief of all
	Christians; that they would provide him with more gold, their treasures
	being inexhaustible, than the King of Spain had ever drawn from the golden
	regions of Eastern and Western Ind.” This was their confession of faith.
	Their rules of conduct were six in number, and as follow:</p>

	<p>First. That, in their travels, they should gratuitously cure all diseases.</p>

	<p>Secondly. That they should always dress in conformity to the fashion of
	the country in which they resided.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"></a>Thirdly. That they should, once every year, meet together in the place
	appointed by the fraternity, or send in writing an available excuse.</p>

	<p>Fourthly. That every brother, whenever he felt inclined to die, should
	choose a person worthy to succeed him.</p>

	<p>Fifthly. That the words “Rose-cross” should be the marks by which they
	should recognise each other.</p>

	<p>Sixthly. That their fraternity should be kept secret for six times twenty
	years.</p>

	<p>They asserted that these laws had been found inscribed in a golden book in
	the tomb of Rosencreutz, and that the six times twenty years from his
	death expired in 1604. They were consequently called upon from that time
	forth to promulgate their doctrine for the welfare of mankind<a href="#fn44" id="fnm44" title=" following legend..." class="fnmarker">44</a>.</p>

	<p>For eight years these enthusiasts made converts in Germany, but they
	excited little or no attention in other parts of Europe. At last they made
	their appearance in Paris, and threw all the learned, all the credulous,
	and all the lovers of the marvellous into commotion. In the beginning of
	March 1623, the good folks of that city, when they arose one morning, were
	surprised to find all their walls placarded with the following singular
	manifesto:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“<em>We, the deputies of the principal College of the Brethren of the
		Rose-cross, have taken up our abode, visible and invisible, in this city,
		by the grace of the Most High, towards whom are turned the hearts of the
		just. We shew and teach without books or signs, and speak all sorts of
		languages in the countries where we dwell, to draw mankind, our fellows,
		from error and from death</em>.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>For a long time this strange placard was the sole topic of conversation <a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"></a>in
	all public places. Some few wondered, but the greater number only laughed
	at it. In the course of a few weeks two books were published, which raised
	the first alarm respecting this mysterious society, whose dwelling-place
	no one knew, and no members of which had ever been seen. The first was
	called a history of <cite>The frightful Compacts entered into between the Devil
	and the pretended ‘Invisibles;’ with their damnable Instructions, the
	deplorable Ruin of their Disciples, and their miserable end</cite>. The other
	was called an <cite>Examination of the new and unknown Cabala of the Brethren
	of the Rose-cross, who have lately inhabited the City of Paris; with the
	History of their Manners, the Wonders worked by them, and many other
	particulars</cite>.</p>

	<p>These books sold rapidly. Every one was anxious to know something of this
	dreadful and secret brotherhood. The <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">badauds</em> of Paris were so alarmed
	that they daily expected to see the arch-enemy walking <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria
	persona</em> among them. It was said in these volumes that the Rosicrucian
	society consisted of six-and-thirty persons in all, who had renounced
	their baptism and hope of resurrection. That it was not by means of good
	angels, as they pretended, that they worked their prodigies; but that it
	was the devil who gave them power to transport themselves from one end of
	the world to the other with the rapidity of thought; to speak all
	languages; to have their purses always full of money, however much they
	might spend; to be invisible, and penetrate into the most secret places,
	in spite of fastenings of bolts and bars; and to be able to tell the past
	and future. These thirty-six brethren were divided into bands or
	companies: six of them only had been sent on the mission to Paris, six to
	Italy, six to Spain, six to Germany, four to Sweden, and two into
	Switzerland, two into Flanders, two into Lorraine, and two into Franche
	Comté. It was generally believed that the missionaries to France resided
	somewhere in the Marais du Temple. That quarter of Paris soon acquired a
	bad name, and people were afraid to take houses in it, lest they should be
	turned out by the six invisibles of the Rose-cross. It was believed by the
	populace, and by many others whose education should have taught them
	better, that persons of a mysterious aspect used to visit the inns and
	hotels of Paris, and eat of the best meats and drink of the best wines,
	and then suddenly melt away into thin air when the landlord came with the
	reckoning. That gentle maidens, who went to bed alone, often awoke in the
	night and found men in bed with them, of shape more beautiful than the
	Grecian Apollo, who immediately became invisible when an alarm was raised.
	It was also said that many persons found large heaps of gold in their
	houses without knowing from whence they came. All Paris was in alarm. No
	man thought himself secure of his goods, no maiden of her virginity, <a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"></a>or
	wife of her chastity, while these Rosicrucians were abroad. In the midst
	of the commotion, a second placard was issued to the following effect:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="reverse_emphasis">“If any one desires to see the brethren of the Rose-cross from curiosity
		only, he will never communicate with us. But if his <em>will</em> really induces
		him to inscribe his name in the register of our brotherhood, we, who can
		judge of the thoughts of all men, will convince him of the truth of our
		promises. For this reason we do not publish to the world the place of our
		abode. Thought alone, in unison with the sincere <em>will</em> of those who
		desire to know us, is sufficient to make us known to them, and them to
		us.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Though the existence of such a society as that of the Rose-cross was
	problematical, it was quite evident that somebody or other was concerned
	in the promulgation of these placards, which were stuck up on every wall
	in Paris. The police endeavoured in vain to find out the offenders, and
	their want of success only served to increase the perplexity of the
	public. The Church very soon took up the question; and the Abbé Gaultier,
	a Jesuit, wrote a book to prove that, by their enmity to the pope, they
	could be no other than disciples of Luther, sent to promulgate his heresy.
	Their very name, he added, proved that they were heretics; a <em>cross</em>
	surmounted by a <em>rose</em> being the heraldic device of the arch-heretic
	Luther. One Garasse said they were a confraternity of drunken impostors;
	and that their name was derived from the garland of roses, in the form of
	a cross, hung over the tables of taverns in Germany as the emblem of
	secrecy, and from whence was derived the common saying, when one man
	communicated a secret to another, that it was said “under the rose.”
	Others interpreted the letters F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C. to mean, not Brethren of the
	Rose-cross, but <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratres Roris Cocti</em>, or Brothers of Boiled Dew; and
	explained this appellation by alleging that they collected large
	quantities of morning dew, and boiled it, in order to extract a very
	valuable ingredient in the composition of the philosopher’s stone and the
	water of life.</p>

	<p>The fraternity thus attacked defended themselves as well as they were
	able. They denied that they used magic of any kind, or that they consulted
	the devil. They said they were all happy; that they had lived more than a
	century, and expected to live many centuries more; and that the intimate
	knowledge which they possessed of all nature was communicated to them by
	God himself as a reward for their piety and utter devotion to his service.
	Those were in error who derived their name from a cross of roses, or
	called them drunkards. To set the world right on the first point, they
	reiterated that they derived their name from Christian Rosencreutz, their
	founder; and to answer the latter charge, they repeated that they knew not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"></a>what thirst was, and had higher pleasures than those of the palate. They
	did not desire to meddle with the politics or religion of any man or set
	of men, although they could not help denying the supremacy of the pope,
	and looking upon him as a tyrant. Many slanders, they said, had been
	repeated respecting them, the most unjust of which was, that they indulged
	in carnal appetites, and, under the cloak of their invisibility, crept
	into the chambers of beautiful maidens. They asserted, on the contrary,
	that the first vow they took on entering the society was a vow of
	chastity, and that any one among them who transgressed in that particular
	would immediately lose all the advantages he enjoyed, and be exposed once
	more to hunger, woe, disease, and death, like other men. So strongly did
	they feel on the subject of chastity, that they attributed the fall of
	Adam solely to his want of this virtue. Besides defending themselves in
	this manner, they entered into a further confession of their faith. They
	discarded for ever all the old tales of sorcery and witchcraft, and
	communion with the devil. They said there were no such horrid, unnatural,
	and disgusting beings as the incubi and succubi, and the innumerable
	grotesque imps that men had believed in for so many ages. Man was not
	surrounded with enemies like these, but with myriads of beautiful and
	beneficent beings, all anxious to do him service. The air was peopled with
	sylphs, the water with undines or naiads, the bowels of the earth with
	gnomes, and the fire with salamanders. All these beings were the friends
	of man, and desired nothing so much as that men should purge themselves of
	all uncleanness, and thus be enabled to see and converse with them. They
	possessed great power, and were unrestrained by the barriers of space or
	the obstructions of matter. But man was in one particular their superior.
	He had an immortal soul, and they had not. They might, however, become
	sharers in man’s immortality if they could inspire one of that race with
	the passion of love towards them. Hence it was the constant endeavour of
	the female spirits to captivate the admiration of men, and of the male
	gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and undines to be beloved by a woman. The
	object of this passion, in returning their love, imparted a portion of
	that celestial fire, the soul; and from that time forth the beloved became
	equal to the lover, and both, when their allotted course was run, entered
	together into the mansions of felicity. These spirits, they said, watched
	constantly over mankind by night and day. Dreams, omens, and presentiments
	were all their works, and the means by which they gave warning of the
	approach of danger. But though so well inclined to befriend man for their
	own sakes, the want of a soul rendered them at times capricious and
	revengeful; they took offence on slight causes, and heaped injuries
	instead of benefits on <a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"></a>the heads of those who extinguished the light of
	reason that was in them by gluttony, debauchery, and other appetites of
	the body.</p>

	<p>The excitement produced in Paris by the placards of the brotherhood and
	the attacks of the clergy wore itself away after a few months. The stories
	circulated about them became at last too absurd even for that age of
	absurdity, and men began to laugh once more at those invisible gentlemen
	and their fantastic doctrines. Gabriel Naudé at that conjuncture brought
	out his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avis à la France sur les Frères de la Rose-croix</cite>, in which he
	very successfully exposed the folly of the new sect. This work, though not
	well written, was well timed. It quite extinguished the Rosicrucians of
	France; and after that year little more was heard of them. Swindlers in
	different parts of the country assumed the name at times to cloak their
	depredations; and now and then one of them was caught and hanged for his
	too great ingenuity in enticing pearls and precious stones from the
	pockets of other people into his own, or for passing off lumps of gilded
	brass for pure gold, made by the agency of the philosopher’s stone. With
	these exceptions, oblivion shrouded them.</p>

	<p>The doctrine was not confined to a sphere so narrow as France alone; it
	still nourished in Germany, and drew many converts in England. The latter
	countries produced two great masters in the persons of Jacob Böhmen and
	Robert Fludd—pretended philosophers, of whom it is difficult to say which
	was the more absurd and extravagant. It would appear that the sect was
	divided into two classes—the brothers <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Roseæ Crucis</em>, who devoted
	themselves to the wonders of this sublunary sphere, and the brothers
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aureæ Crucis</em>, who were wholly occupied in the contemplation of things
	divine. Fludd belonged to the first class, and Böhmen to the second. Fludd
	may be called the father of the English Rosicrucians, and as such merits a
	conspicuous niche in the temple of Folly.</p>

	<p>He was born in the year 1574 at Milgate, in Kent, and was the son of Sir
	Thomas Fludd, Treasurer of War to Queen Elizabeth. He was originally
	intended for the army; but he was too fond of study, and of a disposition
	too quiet and retiring, to shine in that sphere. His father would not
	therefore press him to adopt a course of life for which he was unsuited,
	and encouraged him in the study of medicine, for which he early manifested
	a partiality. At the age of twenty-five he proceeded to the continent; and
	being fond of the abstruse, the marvellous, and the incomprehensible, he
	became an ardent disciple of the school of Paracelsus, whom he looked upon
	as the regenerator not only of medicine, but of philosophy. He remained
	six years in Italy, France, and Germany, storing his mind with fantastic
	notions, and seeking the society of enthusiasts and visionaries. On his
	return <a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"></a>to England in 1605, he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine
	from the University of Oxford, and began to practise as a physician in
	London.</p>

	<p>He soon made himself conspicuous. He latinised his name from Robert Fludd
	into Robertus à Fluctibus, and began the promulgation of many strange
	doctrines. He avowed his belief in the philosopher’s stone, the water of
	life, and the universal alkahest; and maintained that there were but two
	principles of all things,—which were, condensation, the boreal or
	northern virtue; and rarefaction, the southern or austral virtue. A number
	of demons, he said, ruled over the human frame, whom he arranged in their
	places in a rhomboid. Every disease had its peculiar demon who produced
	it, which demon could only be combated by the aid of the demon whose place
	was directly opposite to his in the rhomboidal figure. Of his medical
	notions we shall have further occasion to speak in another part of this
	book, when we consider him in his character as one of the first founders
	of the magnetic delusion, and its offshoot, animal magnetism, which has
	created so much sensation in our own day.</p>

	<p>As if the doctrines already mentioned were not wild enough, he joined the
	Rosicrucians as soon as they began to make a sensation in Europe, and
	succeeded in raising himself to high consideration among them. The
	fraternity having been violently attacked by several German authors, and
	among others by Libavius, Fludd volunteered a reply, and published, in
	1616, his defence of the Rosicrucian philosophy, under the title of the
	<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apologia compendiaria Fraternitatem de Rosea-cruce suspicionis et infamiæ
	maculis aspersam abluens</cite>. This work immediately procured him great renown
	upon the Continent, and he was henceforth looked upon as one of the
	high-priests of the sect. Of so much importance was he considered, that
	Keppler and Gassendi thought it necessary to refute him; and the latter
	wrote a complete examination of his doctrine. Mersenne also, the friend of
	Descartes, and who had defended that philosopher when accused of having
	joined the Rosicrucians, attacked Dr. à Fluctibus, as he preferred to be
	called, and shewed the absurdity of the brothers of the Rose-cross in
	general, and of Dr. à Fluctibus in particular. Fluctibus wrote a long
	reply, in which he called Mersenne an ignorant calumniator, and reiterated
	that alchymy was a profitable science, and the Rosicrucians worthy to be
	the regenerators of the world. This book was published at Frankfort, and
	was entitled <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summum Bonum, quod est Magiæ, Cabalæ, Alchimiæ, Fratrum,
	Roseæ-Crucis verorum, et adversus Mersenium Calumniatorem</cite>. Besides this,
	he wrote several other works upon alchymy, a second answer to Libavius
	upon the Rosicrucians, and many medical works. He died in London in 1637.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"></a>After his time there was some diminution of the sect in England. They
	excited but little attention, and made no effort to bring themselves into
	notice. Occasionally some obscure and almost incomprehensible work made
	its appearance, to shew the world that the folly was not extinguished.
	Eugenius Philalethes, a noted alchymist, who has veiled his real name
	under this assumed one, translated <cite>The Fame and Confession of the
	Brethren of the Rosie Cross</cite>, which was published in London in 1652. A few
	years afterwards, another enthusiast, named John Heydon, wrote two works
	on the subject: the one entitled <cite>The Wise Man’s Crown, or the Glory of
	the Rosie Cross</cite>; and the other, <cite>The Holy Guide, leading the way to unite
	Art and Nature with the Rosie Crosse uncovered</cite>. Neither of these
	attracted much notice. A third book was somewhat more successful; it was
	called <cite>A new Method of Rosicrucian Physic; by John Heydon, the servant of
	God and the Secretary of Nature</cite>. A few extracts will shew the ideas of
	the English Rosicrucians about this period. Its author was an attorney,
	“practising (to use his own words) at Westminster Hall all term times as
	long as he lived, and in the vacations devoting himself to alchymical and
	Rosicrucian meditation.” In his preface, called by him an Apologue for an
	Epilogue, he enlightens the public upon the true history and tenets of his
	sect. Moses, Elias, and Ezekiel were, he says, the most ancient masters of
	the Rosicrucian philosophy. Those few then existing in England and the
	rest of Europe, were as the eyes and ears of the great king of the
	universe, seeing and hearing all things; seraphically illuminated;
	companions of the holy company of unbodied souls and immortal angels;
	turning themselves, Proteus-like, into any shape, and having the power of
	working miracles. The most pious and abstracted brethren could slack the
	plague in cities, silence the violent winds and tempests, calm the rage of
	the sea and rivers, walk in the air, frustrate the malicious aspect of
	witches, cure all diseases, and turn all metals into gold. He had known in
	his time two famous brethren of the Rosie Cross, named Walfourd and
	Williams, who had worked miracles in his sight, and taught him many
	excellent predictions of astrology and earthquakes. “I desired one of
	these to tell me,” says he, “whether my complexion were capable of the
	society of my good genius. ‘When I see you again,’ said he (which was when
	he pleased to come to me, for I knew not where to go to him), ‘I will tell
	you.’ When I saw him afterwards, he said, ‘You should pray to God; for a
	good and holy man can offer no greater or more acceptable service to God
	than the oblation of himself—his soul.’ He said also, that the good genii
	were the benign eyes of God, running to and fro in the world, and with
	love and pity beholding the innocent endeavours of harmless <a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"></a>and
	single-hearted men, ever ready to do them good and to help them.”</p>

	<p>Heydon held devoutly true that dogma of the Rosicrucians which said that
	neither eating nor drinking was necessary to men. He maintained that any
	one might exist in the same manner as that singular people dwelling near
	the source of the Ganges, of whom mention was made in the travels of his
	namesake, Sir Christopher Heydon, who had no mouths, and therefore could
	not eat, but lived by the breath of their nostrils; except when they took
	a far journey, and then they mended their diet with the smell of flowers.
	He said that in really pure air “there was a fine foreign fatness,” with
	which it was sprinkled by the sunbeams, and which was quite sufficient for
	the nourishment of the generality of mankind. Those who had enormous
	appetites, he had no objection to see take animal food, since they could
	not do without it; but he obstinately insisted that there was no necessity
	why they should <em>eat</em> it. If they put a plaster of nicely-cooked meat upon
	their epigastrium, it would be sufficient for the wants of the most robust
	and voracious! They would by that means let in no diseases, as they did at
	the broad and common gate, the mouth, as any one might see by example of
	drink; for all the while a man sat in water, he was never athirst. He had
	known, he said, many Rosicrucians, who by applying wine in this manner,
	had fasted for years together. In fact, quoth Heydon, we may easily fast
	all our life, though it be three hundred years, without any kind of meat,
	and so cut off all danger of disease.</p>

	<p>This “sage philosopher” further informed his wondering contemporaries that
	the chiefs of the doctrine always carried about with them to their place
	of meeting their symbol, called the R.&nbsp;C. which was an ebony cross,
	flourished and decked with roses of gold; the cross typifying Christ’s
	sufferings upon the cross for our sins, and the roses of gold the glory
	and beauty of his Resurrection. This symbol was carried alternately to
	Mecca, Mount Calvary, Mount Sinai, Haran, and to three other places, which
	must have been in mid-air, called <em>Cascle</em>, <em>Apamia</em> and <em>Chaulateau
	Virissa Caunuch</em>, where the Rosicrucian brethren met when they pleased,
	and made resolution of all their actions. They always took their pleasures
	in one of these places, where they resolved all questions of whatsoever
	had been done, was done, or should be done in the world, from the
	beginning to the end thereof. “And these,” he concludes, “are the men
	called Rosicrucians!”</p>

	<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, more rational ideas took
	possession of the sect, which still continued to boast of a few members.
	They appear to have considered that contentment was the true philosopher’s
	stone, and to have abandoned the insane search <a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"></a>for a mere phantom of the
	imagination. Addison, in <cite>The Spectator</cite>,<a href="#fn45" id="fnm45" title="No. 574..." class="fnmarker">45</a> gives an account of his
	conversation with a Rosicrucian; from which it may be inferred that the
	sect had grown wiser in their deeds, though in their talk they were as
	foolish as ever. “I was once,” says he, “engaged in discourse with a
	Rosicrucian about the great secret. He talked of the secret as of a spirit
	which lived within an emerald, and converted every thing that was near it
	to the highest perfection that it was capable of. ‘It gives a lustre,’
	says he, ‘to the sun, and water to the diamond. It irradiates every metal,
	and enriches lead with all the properties of gold. It heightens smoke into
	flame, flame into light, and light into glory.’ He further added, ‘that a
	single ray of it dissipates pain and care and melancholy from the person
	on whom it falls. In short,’ says he, ‘its presence naturally changes
	every place into a kind of heaven.’ After he had gone on for some time in
	this unintelligible cant, I found that he jumbled natural and moral ideas
	together into the same discourse, and that his great secret was nothing
	else but content.”</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Jacob Böhmen.</h3>

	<p>It is now time to speak of Jacob Böhmen, who thought he could discover the
	secret of the transmutation of metals in the Bible, and who invented a
	strange heterogeneous doctrine of mingled alchymy and religion, and
	founded upon it the sect of the Aurea-crucians. He was born at Görlitz, in
	Upper Lusatia, in 1575, and followed till his thirtieth year the
	occupation of a shoemaker. In this obscurity he remained, with the
	character of a visionary and a man of unsettled mind, until the
	promulgation of the Rosicrucian philosophy in his part of Germany, toward
	the year 1607 or 1608. From that time he began to neglect his leather, and
	buried his brain under the rubbish of metaphysics. The works of Paracelsus
	fell into his hands; and these, with the reveries of the Rosicrucians, so
	completely engrossed his attention, that he abandoned his trade
	altogether, sinking, at the same time, from a state of comparative
	independence into poverty and destitution. But he was nothing daunted by
	the miseries and privations of the flesh; his mind was fixed upon the
	beings of another sphere, and in thought he was already the new apostle of
	the human race. In the year 1612, after a meditation of four years, he
	published his first work, entitled <cite>Aurora, or the Rising of the Sun</cite>;
	embodying the ridiculous notions of Paracelsus, and worse confounding the
	confusion of that writer. The philosopher’s stone might, he contended, be
	discovered by a diligent search of the Old <a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"></a>and New Testaments, and more
	especially of the Apocalypse, which alone contained all the secrets of
	alchymy. He contended that the divine grace operated by the same rules,
	and followed the same methods, that the divine providence observed in the
	natural world; and that the minds of men were purged from their vices and
	corruptions in the very same manner that metals were purified from their
	dross, namely, by fire.</p>

	<p>Besides the sylphs, gnomes, undines, and salamanders, he acknowledged
	various ranks and orders of demons. He pretended to invisibility and
	absolute chastity. He also said that, if it pleased him, he could abstain
	for years from meat and drink, and all the necessities of the body. It is
	needless, however, to pursue his follies any further. He was reprimanded
	for writing this work by the magistrates of Görlitz, and commanded to
	leave the pen alone and stick to his wax, that his family might not become
	chargeable to the parish. He neglected this good advice, and continued his
	studies; burning minerals and purifying metals one day, and mystifying the
	Word of God on the next. He afterwards wrote three other works, as
	sublimely ridiculous as the first. The one was entitled <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Metallurgia</cite>, and
	has the slight merit of being the least obscure of his compositions.
	Another was called <cite>The Temporal Mirror of Eternity</cite>; and the last his
	<cite>Theosophy revealed</cite>, full of allegories and metaphors,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p class="i12">“All strange and geason,</p>
		<p>Devoid of sense and ordinary reason.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>Böhmen died in 1624, leaving behind him a considerable number of admiring
	disciples. Many of them became, during the seventeenth century, as
	distinguished for absurdity as their master; amongst whom may be mentioned
	Gifftheil, Wendenhagen, John Jacob Zimmermann, and Abraham Frankenberg.
	Their heresy rendered them obnoxious to the Church of Rome; and many of
	them suffered long imprisonment and torture for their faith. One, named
	Kuhlmann, was burned alive at Moscow, in 1684, on a charge of sorcery.
	Böhmen’s works were translated into English, and published, many years
	afterwards, by an enthusiast named William Law.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Mormius.</h3>

	<p>Peter Mormius, a notorious alchymist and contemporary of Böhmen,
	endeavoured, in 1630, to introduce the Rosicrucian philosophy into
	Holland. He applied to the States-General to grant him a public audience,
	that he might explain the tenets of the sect, and disclose a plan for
	rendering Holland the happiest and richest country on the earth, by means
	of the philosopher’s stone and the service of the <a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"></a>elementary spirits. The
	States-General wisely resolved to have nothing to do with him. He
	thereupon determined to shame them by printing his book, which he did at
	Leyden the same year. It was entitled <cite>The Book of the most Hidden Secrets
	of Nature</cite>, and was divided into three parts; the first treating of
	“perpetual motion;” the second of the “transmutation of metals;” and the
	third of the “universal medicine.” He also published some German works
	upon the Rosicrucian philosophy, at Frankfort, in 1617.</p>

	<p>Poetry and romance are deeply indebted to the Rosicrucians for many a
	graceful creation. The literature of England, France, and Germany contains
	hundreds of sweet fictions, whose machinery has been borrowed from their
	day-dreams. The “delicate Ariel” of Shakspeare stands pre-eminent among
	the number. From the same source Pope drew the airy tenants of Belinda’s
	dressing-room, in his charming <cite>Rape of the Lock</cite>; and La Motte Fouqué,
	the beautiful and capricious water-nymph Undine, around whom he has thrown
	more grace and loveliness, and for whose imaginary woes he has excited
	more sympathy, than ever were bestowed on a supernatural being. Sir Walter
	Scott also endowed the White Lady of Avenel with many of the attributes of
	the undines or water-sprites. German romance and lyrical poetry teem with
	allusions to sylphs, gnomes, undines, and salamanders; and the French have
	not been behind in substituting them, in works of fiction, for the more
	cumbrous mythology of Greece and Rome. The sylphs, more especially, have
	been the favourites of the bards, and have become so familiar to the
	popular mind as to be, in a manner, confounded with that other race of
	ideal beings, the fairies, who can boast of an antiquity much more
	venerable in the annals of superstition. Having these obligations to the
	Rosicrucians, no lover of poetry can wish, however absurd they were, that
	such a sect of philosophers had never existed.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Borri.</h3>

	<p>Just at the time that Michael Mayer was making known to the world the
	existence of such a body as the Rosicrucians, there was born in Italy a
	man who was afterwards destined to become the most conspicuous member of
	the fraternity. The alchymic mania never called forth the ingenuity of a
	more consummate or more successful impostor than Joseph Francis Borri. He
	was born in 1616, according to some authorities, and in 1627 according to
	others, at Milan; where his father, the Signor Branda Borri, practised as
	a physician. At the age of sixteen Joseph was sent to finish his education
	at the Jesuits’ college in Rome, where he distinguished himself by his
	extraordinary memory. He learned every thing to which he applied <a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"></a>himself
	with the utmost ease. In the most voluminous works no fact was too minute
	for his retention, and no study was so abstruse but that he could master
	it; but any advantages he might have derived from this facility were
	neutralised by his ungovernable passions and his love of turmoil and
	debauchery. He was involved in continual difficulty, as well with the
	heads of the college as with the police of Rome, and acquired so bad a
	character that years could not remove it. By the aid of his friends he
	established himself as a physician in Rome, and also obtained some
	situation in the pope’s household. In one of his fits of studiousness he
	grew enamoured of alchymy, and determined to devote his energies to the
	discovery of the philosopher’s stone. Of unfortunate propensities he had
	quite sufficient, besides this, to bring him to poverty. His pleasures
	were as expensive as his studies, and both were of a nature to destroy his
	health and ruin his fair fame. At the age of thirty-seven he found that he
	could not live by the practice of medicine, and began to look about for
	some other employment. He became, in 1653, private secretary to the
	Marquis di Mirogli, the minister of the Archduke of Innsprück at the court
	of Rome. He continued in this capacity for two years; leading, however,
	the same abandoned life as heretofore, frequenting the society of
	gamesters, debauchees, and loose women, involving himself in disgraceful
	street quarrels, and alienating the patrons who were desirous to befriend
	him.</p>

	<p>All at once a sudden change was observed in his conduct. The abandoned
	rake put on the outward sedateness of a philosopher; the scoffing sinner
	proclaimed that he had forsaken his evil ways, and would live thenceforth
	a model of virtue. To his friends this reformation was as pleasing as it
	was unexpected; and Borri gave obscure hints that it had been brought
	about by some miraculous manifestation of a superior power. He pretended
	that he held converse with beneficent spirits; that the secrets of God and
	nature were revealed to him; and that he had obtained possession of the
	philosopher’s stone. Like his predecessor, Jacob Böhmen, he mixed up
	religious questions with his philosophical jargon, and took measures for
	declaring himself the founder of a new sect. This, at Rome itself, and in
	the very palace of the pope, was a hazardous proceeding; and Borri just
	awoke to a sense of it in time to save himself from the dungeons of the
	Castle of St. Angelo. He fled to Innsprück, where he remained about a
	year, and then returned to his native city of Milan.</p>

	<div class="figcenter" style="width:304px;">
		<a href="images/image43.png"><img src="images/th_image43.png" alt="A town in front of a towering mountain." id="image43" width="304" height="386" /></a>
		<p class="caption">INNSPRUCK.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The reputation of his great sanctity had gone before him; and he found
	many persons ready to attach themselves to his fortunes. All who were
	desirous of entering into the new communion took an oath <a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"></a>of poverty, and
	relinquished their possessions for the general good of the fraternity.
	Borri told them that he had received from the archangel Michael a heavenly
	sword, upon the hilt of which were engraven the names of the seven
	celestial intelligences. “Whoever shall refuse,” said he, “to enter into
	my new sheepfold shall be destroyed by the papal armies, of whom God has
	predestined me to be the chief. To those who follow me all joy shall be
	granted. I shall soon bring my chemical studies to a happy conclusion, by
	the discovery of the philosopher’s stone, and by this means we shall all
	have as much gold as we desire. I am assured of the aid of the angelic
	hosts, and more especially of the archangel Michael’s. When I began to
	walk in the way of the spirit, I had a vision of the night, and was
	assured by <a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"></a>an angelic voice that I should become a prophet. In sign of it
	I saw a palm-tree, surrounded with all the glory of paradise. The angels
	come to me whenever I call, and reveal to me all the secrets of the
	universe. The sylphs and elementary spirits obey me, and fly to the
	uttermost ends of the world to serve me, and those whom I delight to
	honour.” By force of continually repeating such stories as these, Borri
	soon found himself at the head of a very considerable number of adherents.
	As he figures in these pages as an alchymist, and not as a religious
	sectarian, it will be unnecessary to repeat the doctrines which he taught
	with regard to some of the dogmas of the Church of Rome, and which exposed
	him to the fierce resentment of the papal authority. They were to the full
	as ridiculous as his philosophical pretensions. As the number of his
	followers increased, he appears to have cherished the idea of becoming one
	day a new Mahomet, and of founding, in his native city of Milan, a
	monarchy and religion of which he should be the king and the prophet. He
	had taken measures, in the year 1658, for seizing the guards at all the
	gates of that city, and formally declaring himself the monarch of the
	Milanese. Just as he thought the plan ripe for execution, it was
	discovered. Twenty of his followers were arrested, and he himself managed,
	with the utmost difficulty, to escape to the neutral territory of
	Switzerland, where the papal displeasure could not reach him.</p>

	<p>The trial of his followers commenced forthwith, and the whole of them were
	sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. Borri’s trial proceeded in his
	absence, and lasted for upwards of two years. He was condemned to death as
	a heretic and sorcerer in 1661, and was burned in effigy in Rome by the
	common hangman.</p>

	<p>Borri, in the mean time, lived quietly in Switzerland, indulging himself
	in railing at the Inquisition and its proceedings. He afterwards went to
	Strasbourg, intending to fix his residence in that town. He was received
	with great cordiality, as a man persecuted for his religious opinions, and
	withal a great alchymist. He found that sphere too narrow for his aspiring
	genius, and retired in the same year to the more wealthy city of
	Amsterdam. He there hired a magnificent house, established an equipage
	which eclipsed in brilliancy those of the richest merchants, and assumed
	the title of Excellency. Where he got the money to live in this expensive
	style was long a secret: the adepts in alchymy easily explained it, after
	their fashion. Sensible people were of opinion that he had come by it in a
	less wonderful manner; for it was remembered that among his unfortunate
	disciples in Milan, there were many rich men, who, in conformity with one
	of the fundamental rules of the sect, had given up all their earthly
	wealth into the hands of their founder. In whatever manner <a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"></a>the money was
	obtained, Borri spent it in Holland with an unsparing hand, and was looked
	up to by the people with no little respect and veneration. He performed
	several able cures, and increased his reputation so much that he was
	vaunted as a prodigy. He continued diligently the operations of alchymy,
	and was in daily expectation that he should succeed in turning the
	inferior metals into gold. This hope never abandoned him, even in the
	worst extremity of his fortunes; and in his prosperity it led him into the
	most foolish expenses: but he could not long continue to live so
	magnificently upon the funds he had brought from Italy; and the
	philosopher’s stone, though it promised all for the wants of the morrow,
	never brought any thing for the necessities of to-day. He was obliged in a
	few months to retrench, by giving up his large house, his gilded coach and
	valuable blood-horses, his liveried domestics, and his luxurious
	entertainments. With this diminution of splendour came a diminution of
	renown. His cures did not appear so miraculous, when he went out on foot
	to perform them, as they had seemed when “his Excellency” had driven to a
	poor man’s door in his carriage with six horses. He sank from a prodigy
	into an ordinary man. His great friends shewed him the cold shoulder, and
	his humble flatterers carried their incense to some other shrine. Borri
	now thought it high time to change his quarters. With this view he
	borrowed money wherever he could get it, and succeeded in obtaining two
	hundred thousand florins from a merchant named De Meer, to aid, as he
	said, in discovering the water of life. He also obtained six diamonds of
	great value, on pretence that he could remove the flaws from them without
	diminishing their weight. With this booty he stole away secretly by night,
	and proceeded to Hamburgh.</p>

	<p>On his arrival in that city, he found the celebrated Christina, the
	ex-queen of Sweden. He procured an introduction to her, and requested her
	patronage in his endeavour to discover the philosopher’s stone. She gave
	him some encouragement; but Borri, fearing that the merchants of
	Amsterdam, who had connexions in Hamburgh, might expose his delinquencies
	if he remained in the latter city, passed over to Copenhagen, and sought
	the protection of Frederick III., the king of Denmark.</p>

	<p>This prince was a firm believer in the transmutation of metals. Being in
	want of money, he readily listened to the plans of an adventurer who had
	both eloquence and ability to recommend him. He provided Borri with the
	means to make experiments, and took a great interest in the progress of
	his operations. He expected every month to possess riches that would buy
	Peru; and, when he was disappointed, accepted patiently the excuses of
	Borri, who, upon every failure, was <a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"></a>always ready with some plausible
	explanation. He became in time much attached to him; and defended him from
	the jealous attacks of his courtiers, and the indignation of those who
	were grieved to see their monarch the easy dupe of a charlatan. Borri
	endeavoured, by every means in his power, to find aliment for this good
	opinion. His knowledge of medicine was useful to him in this respect, and
	often stood between him and disgrace. He lived six years in this manner at
	the court of Frederick; but that monarch dying in 1670 he was left without
	a protector.</p>

	<p>As he had made more enemies than friends in Copenhagen, and had nothing to
	hope from the succeeding sovereign, he sought an asylum in another
	country. He went first to Saxony; but met so little encouragement, and
	encountered so much danger from the emissaries of the Inquisition, that he
	did not remain there many months. Anticipating nothing but persecution in
	every country that acknowledged the spiritual authority of the pope, he
	appears to have taken the resolution to dwell in Turkey, and turn
	Mussulman. On his arrival at the Hungarian frontier, on his way to
	Constantinople, he was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the
	conspiracy of the Counts Nadasdi and Frangipani, which had just been
	discovered. In vain he protested his innocence, and divulged his real name
	and profession. He was detained in prison, and a letter despatched to the
	Emperor Leopold, to know what should be done with him. The star of his
	fortunes was on the decline. The letter reached Leopold at an unlucky
	moment. The pope’s nuncio was closeted with his majesty; and he no sooner
	heard the name of Joseph Francis Borri, than he demanded him as a prisoner
	of the Holy See. The request was complied with; and Borri, closely
	manacled, was sent under an escort of soldiers to the prison of the
	Inquisition at Rome. He was too much of an impostor to be deeply tinged
	with fanaticism, and was not unwilling to make a public recantation of his
	heresies, if he could thereby save his life. When the proposition was made
	to him, he accepted it with eagerness. His punishment was to be commuted
	into the hardly less severe one of perpetual imprisonment; but he was too
	happy to escape the clutch of the executioner at any price, and he made
	the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</em> in face of the assembled multitudes of Rome on the
	27th of October 1672. He was then transferred to the prisons of the Castle
	of St. Angelo, where he remained till his death, twenty-three years
	afterwards. It is said that, towards the close of his life, considerable
	indulgence was granted him; that he was allowed to have a laboratory, and
	to cheer the solitude of his dungeon by searching for the philosopher’s
	stone. Queen Christina, during her residence at Rome, frequently visited
	the old man, to converse with him upon <a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"></a>chemistry and the doctrines of the
	Rosicrucians. She even obtained permission that he should leave his prison
	occasionally for a day or two, and reside in her palace, she being
	responsible for his return to captivity. She encouraged him to search for
	the great secret of the alchymists, and provided him with money for the
	purpose. It may well be supposed that Borri benefited most by this
	acquaintance, and that Christina got nothing but experience. It is not
	sure that she gained even that; for until her dying day she was convinced
	of the possibility of finding the philosopher’s stone, and ready to assist
	any adventurer either zealous or impudent enough to pretend to it.</p>

	<p>After Borri had been about eleven years in confinement, a small volume was
	published at Cologne, entitled <cite>The Key of the Cabinet of the Chevalier
	Joseph Francis Borri, in which are contained many curious Letters upon
	Chemistry and other Sciences, written by him, together with a Memoir of
	his Life</cite>. This book contained a complete exposition of the Rosicrucian
	philosophy, and afforded materials to the Abbé de Villars for his
	interesting <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Count de Gabalis</cite>, which excited so much attention at the
	close of the seventeenth century.</p>

	<p>Borri lingered in the prison of St. Angelo till 1695, when he died, in his
	eightieth year. Besides <cite>The Key of the Cabinet</cite>, written originally in
	Copenhagen, in 1666, for the edification of King Frederick III., he
	published a work upon alchymy and the secret sciences, under the title of
	<cite>The Mission of Romulus to the Romans</cite>.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Inferior Alchymists of the Seventeenth Century.</h3>

	<p>Besides the pretenders to the philosopher’s stone whose lives have been
	already narrated, this and the preceding century produced a great number
	of writers, who inundated literature with their books upon the subject. In
	fact, most of the learned men of that age had some faith in it. Van
	Helmont, Borrichius, Kircher, Boerhaave, and a score of others, though not
	professed alchymists, were fond of the science, and countenanced its
	professors. Helvetius, the grandfather of the celebrated philosopher of
	the same name, asserts that he saw an inferior metal turned into gold by a
	stranger, at the Hague, in 1666. He says, that, sitting one day in his
	study, a man, who was dressed as a respectable burgher of North Holland,
	and very modest and simple in his appearance, called upon him, with the
	intention of dispelling his doubts relative to the philosopher’s stone. He
	asked Helvetius if he thought he should know that rare gem if he saw it.
	To which Helvetius replied, that he certainly should not. The burgher
	immediately drew from his pocket a small ivory box, containing three
	pieces of metal, of the colour of brimstone, and extremely heavy; and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186"></a>assured Helvetius, that of them he could make as much as twenty tons of
	gold. Helvetius informs us, that he examined them very attentively; and
	seeing that they were very brittle, he took the opportunity to scrape off
	a small portion with his thumb-nail. He then returned them to the
	stranger, with an entreaty that he would perform the process of
	transmutation before him. The stranger replied, that he was not allowed to
	do so, and went away. After his departure, Helvetius procured a crucible
	and a portion of lead, into which, when in a state of fusion, he threw the
	stolen grain from the philosopher’s stone. He was disappointed to find
	that the grain evaporated altogether, leaving the lead in its original
	state.</p>

	<p>Some weeks afterwards, when he had almost forgotten the subject, he
	received another visit from the stranger. He again entreated him to
	explain the processes by which he pretended to transmute lead. The
	stranger at last consented, and informed him, that one grain was
	sufficient; but that it was necessary to envelope it in a ball of wax
	before throwing it on the molten metal; otherwise its extreme volatility
	would cause it to go off in vapour. They tried the experiment, and
	succeeded to their heart’s content. Helvetius repeated the experiment
	alone, and converted six ounces of lead into very pure gold.</p>

	<p>The fame of this event spread all over the Hague, and all the notable
	persons of the town flocked to the study of Helvetius to convince
	themselves of the fact. Helvetius performed the experiment again, in the
	presence of the Prince of Orange, and several times afterwards, until he
	exhausted the whole of the powder he had received from the stranger, from
	whom it is necessary to state, he never received another visit; nor did he
	ever discover his name or condition. In the following year, Helvetius
	published his <cite>Golden Calf</cite>,<a href="#fn46" id="fnm46" title="'Vitulus Aureus...'" class="fnmarker">46</a> in which he detailed the above
	circumstances.</p>

	<p>About the same time, the celebrated Father Kircher published his
	<cite>Subterranean World</cite>, in which he called the alchymists a congregation of
	knaves and impostors, and their science a delusion. He admitted that he
	had himself been a diligent labourer in the field, and had only come to
	this conclusion after mature consideration and repeated fruitless
	experiments. All the alchymists were in arms immediately, to refute this
	formidable antagonist. One Solomon de Blauenstein was the first to grapple
	with him, and attempted to convict him of wilful misrepresentation, by
	recalling to his memory the transmutations by Sendivogius, before the
	Emperor Frederick III. and the Elector of Mayence, all performed within a
	recent period. Zwelfer and <a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"></a>Glauber also entered into the dispute, and
	attributed the enmity of Father Kircher to spite and jealousy against
	adepts who had been more successful than himself.</p>

	<p>It was also pretended that Gustavus Adolphus transmuted a quantity of
	quicksilver into pure gold. The learned Borrichius relates, that he saw
	coins which had been struck of this gold; and Lenglet du Fresnoy deposes
	to the same circumstance. In the <cite>Travels of Monconis</cite> the story is told
	in the following manner: “A merchant of Lubeck, who carried on but little
	trade, but who knew how to change lead into very good gold, gave the King
	of Sweden a lingot which he had made, weighing at least one hundred
	pounds. The king immediately caused it to be coined into ducats; and
	because he knew positively that its origin was such as had been stated to
	him, he had his own arms graven upon the one side, and emblematical
	figures of Mercury and Venus on the other. I (continued Monconis) have one
	of these ducats in my possession; and was credibly informed that, after
	the death of the Lubeck merchant, who had never appeared very rich, a sum
	of no less than one million seven hundred thousand crowns was found in his
	coffers.”<a href="#fn47" id="fnm47" title="Voyages de Monconis..." class="fnmarker">47</a></p>

	<p>Such stories as these, confidently related by men high in station, tended
	to keep up the infatuation of the alchymists in every country of Europe.
	It is astonishing to see the number of works which were written upon the
	subject during the seventeenth century alone, and the number of clever men
	who sacrificed themselves to the delusion. Gabriel de Castaigne, a monk of
	the order of St. Francis, attracted so much notice in the reign of Louis
	XIII., that that monarch secured him in his household, and made him his
	Grand Almoner. He pretended to find the elixir of life, and Louis expected
	by his means to have enjoyed the crown for a century. Van Helmont also
	pretended to have once performed with success the process of transmuting
	quicksilver, and was in consequence invited by the Emperor Rudolph II. to
	fix his residence at the court of Vienna. Glauber, the inventor of the
	salts which still bear his name, and who practised as a physician at
	Amsterdam about the middle of the seventeenth century, established a
	public school in that city for the study of alchymy, and gave lectures
	himself upon the science. John Joachim Becher of Spire acquired great
	reputation at the same period, and was convinced that much gold might be
	made out of flint-stones by a peculiar process, and the aid of that grand
	and incomprehensible substance the philosopher’s stone. He made a
	proposition to the Emperor Leopold of Austria to aid him in these
	experiments; but the hope of success was too remote, and the present
	expense too great, to tempt that monarch, <a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"></a>and he therefore gave Becher
	much of his praise, but none of his money. Becher afterwards tried the
	States-General of Holland with no better success.</p>

	<p>With regard to the innumerable tricks by which impostors persuaded the
	world that they had succeeded in making gold, and of which so many stories
	were current about this period, a very satisfactory report was read by M.
	Geoffroy the elder, at the sitting of the Royal Academy of Sciences at
	Paris, on the 15th of April, 1722. As it relates principally to the
	alchymic cheats of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the following
	abridgment of it may not be out of place in this portion of our history.
	The instances of successful transmutation were so numerous, and apparently
	so well authenticated, that nothing short of so able an exposure as that
	of M. Geoffroy could disabuse the public mind. The trick to which they
	oftenest had recourse was to use a double-bottomed crucible, the under
	surface being of iron or copper, and the upper one of wax, painted to
	resemble the same metal. Between the two they placed as much gold or
	silver dust as was necessary for their purpose. They then put in their
	lead, quicksilver, or other ingredients, and placed their pot upon the
	fire. Of course, when the experiment was concluded, they never failed to
	find a lump of gold at the bottom. The same result was produced in many
	other ways. Some of them used a hollow wand, filled with gold or silver
	dust, and stopped at the ends with wax or butter. With this they stirred
	the boiling metal in their crucibles, taking care to accompany the
	operation with many ceremonies, to divert attention from the real purpose
	of the manœuvre. They also drilled holes in lumps of lead, into which
	they poured molten gold, and carefully closed the aperture with the
	original metal. Sometimes they washed a piece of gold with quicksilver.
	When in this state, they found no difficulty in palming it off upon the
	uninitiated as an inferior metal, and very easily transmuted it into fine
	sonorous gold again with the aid of a little aquafortis.</p>

	<p>Others imposed by means of nails, half iron and half gold or silver. They
	pretended that they really transmuted the precious half from iron, by
	dipping it in a strong alcohol. M. Geoffroy produced several of these
	nails to the Academy of Sciences, and shewed how nicely the two parts were
	soldered together. The golden or silver half was painted black to resemble
	iron, and the colour immediately disappeared when the nail was dipped into
	aquafortis. A nail of this description was, for a long time, in the
	cabinet of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Such also, said M. Geoffroy, was the
	knife presented by a monk to Queen Elizabeth of England; the blade of
	which was half gold and half steel. Nothing at one time was more common
	than to see coins, half gold <a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"></a>and half silver, which had been operated upon
	by alchymists, for the same purposes of trickery. In fact, says M.
	Geoffroy, in concluding his long report, there is every reason to believe
	that all the famous histories which have been handed down to us about the
	transmutation of metals into gold or silver, by means of the powder of
	projection or philosophical elixirs, are founded upon some successful
	deception of the kind above narrated. These pretended philosophers
	invariably disappeared after the first or second experiment, or their
	powders or elixirs have failed to produce their effect, either because
	attention being excited they have found no opportunity to renew the trick
	without being discovered, or because they have not had sufficient gold
	dust for more than one trial.</p>

	<p>The disinterestedness of these would-be philosophers looked, at first
	sight, extremely imposing. Instances were not rare in which they
	generously abandoned all the profits of their transmutations—even the
	honour of the discovery. But this apparent disinterestedness was one of
	the most cunning of their manœuvres. It served to keep up the popular
	expectation; it seemed to shew the possibility of discovering the
	philosopher’s stone, and provided the means of future advantages, which
	they were never slow to lay hold of—such as entrances into royal
	households, maintenance at the public expense, and gifts from ambitious
	potentates, too greedy after the gold they so easily promised.</p>

	<p>It now only remains to trace the progress of the delusion from the
	commencement of the eighteenth century until the present day. It will be
	seen that, until a very recent period, there were but slight signs of a
	return to reason.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Jean Delisle.</h3>

	<p>In the year 1705, there was much talk in France of a blacksmith, named
	Delisle, who had discovered the philosopher’s stone, and who went about
	the country turning lead into gold. He was a native of Provence, from
	which place his fame soon spread to the capital. His early life is
	involved in obscurity; but Lenglet du Fresnoy has industriously collected
	some particulars of his later career, which possess considerable interest.
	He was a man without any education, and had been servant in his youth to
	an alchymist, from whom he learned many of the tricks of the fraternity.
	The name of his master has never been discovered; but it is pretended that
	he rendered himself in some manner obnoxious to the government of Louis
	XIV., and was obliged, in consequence, to take refuge in Switzerland.
	Delisle accompanied him as far as Savoy, and there, it is said, set upon
	him in a solitary mountain-pass, and murdered and robbed him. He then
	<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"></a>disguised himself as a pilgrim, and returned to France. At a lonely inn,
	by the road-side, where he stopped for the night, he became acquainted
	with a woman, named Aluys; and so sudden a passion was enkindled betwixt
	them, that she consented to leave all, follow him, and share his good or
	evil fortune wherever he went. They lived together for five or six years
	in Provence, without exciting any attention, apparently possessed of a
	decent independence. At last, in 1706, it was given out that he was the
	possessor of the philosopher’s stone; and people from far and near came
	flocking to his residence, at the Château de la Palu, at Sylanez, near
	Barjaumont, to witness the wealth he could make out of pumps and
	fire-shovels. The following account of his operations is given in a letter
	addressed by M. de Cerisy, the Prior of Châteauneuf, in the Diocese of
	Riez, in Provence, to the Vicar of St. Jacques du Hautpas, at Paris, and
	dated the 18th of November, 1706:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“I have something to relate to you, my dear cousin, which will be
		interesting to you and your friends. The philosopher’s stone, which so
		many persons have looked upon as a chimera, is at last found. It is a man
		named Delisle, of the parish of Sylanez, and residing within a quarter of
		a league of me, that has discovered this great secret. He turns lead into
		gold, and iron into silver, by merely heating these metals red hot, and
		pouring upon them in that state some oil and powder he is possessed of; so
		that it would not be impossible for any man to make a million a day, if he
		had sufficient of this wondrous mixture. Some of the pale gold which he
		had made in this manner, he sent to the jewellers of Lyons, to have their
		opinion on its quality. He also sold twenty pounds weight of it to a
		merchant of Digne, named Taxis. All the jewellers say they never saw such
		fine gold in their lives. He makes nails, part gold, part iron, and part
		silver. He promised to give me one of them, in a long conversation which I
		had with him the other day, by order of the Bishop of Senés, who saw his
		operations with his own eyes, and detailed all the circumstances to me.</p>

		<p>“The Baron and Baroness de Rheinwald shewed me a lingot of gold made out
		of pewter before their eyes by M. Delisle. My brother-in-law Sauveur, who
		has wasted fifty years of his life in this great study, brought me the
		other day a nail which he had seen changed into gold by Delisle, and fully
		convinced me that all his previous experiments were founded on an
		erroneous principle. This excellent workman received, a short time ago, a
		very kind letter from the superintendent of the royal household, which I
		read. He offered to use all his influence with the ministers to prevent
		any attempts upon his liberty, which has twice been attacked by the agents
		of government. <a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"></a>It is believed that the oil he makes use of, is gold or
		silver reduced to that state. He leaves it for a long time exposed to the
		rays of the sun. He told me that it generally took him six months to make
		all his preparations. I told him that, apparently, the king wanted to see
		him. He replied that he could not exercise his art in every place, as a
		certain climate and temperature were absolutely necessary to his success.
		The truth is, that this man appears to have no ambition. He only keeps two
		horses and two men-servants. Besides, he loves his liberty, has no
		politeness, and speaks very bad French; but his judgment seems to be
		solid. He was formerly no more than a blacksmith, but excelled in that
		trade without having been taught it. All the great lords and seigneurs
		from far and near come to visit him, and pay such court to him, that it
		seems more like idolatry than any thing else. Happy would France be if
		this man would discover his secret to the king, to whom the superintendent
		has already sent some lingots! But the happiness is too great to be hoped
		for; for I fear that the workman and his secret will expire together.
		There is no doubt that this discovery will make a great noise in the
		kingdom, unless the character of the man, which I have just depicted to
		you, prevent it. At all events, posterity will hear of him.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>In another letter to the same person, dated the 27th of January 1707, M.
	de Cerisy says, “My dear cousin, I spoke to you in my last letter of the
	famous alchymist of Provence, M. Delisle. A good deal of that was only
	hearsay, but now I am enabled to speak from my own experience. I have in
	my possession a nail, half iron and half silver, which I made myself. That
	great and admirable workman also bestowed a still greater privilege upon
	me—he allowed me turn a piece of lead which I had brought with me into
	pure gold, by means of his wonderful oil and powder. All the country have
	their eyes upon this gentleman; some deny loudly, others are incredulous;
	but those who have seen acknowledge the truth. I have read the passport
	that has been sent to him from court, with orders that he should present
	himself at Paris early in the spring. He told me that he would go
	willingly, and that it was himself who fixed the spring for his departure;
	as he wanted to collect his materials, in order that, immediately on his
	introduction to the king, he might make an experiment worthy of his
	majesty, by converting a large quantity of lead into the finest gold. I
	sincerely hope that he will not allow his secret to die with him, but that
	he will communicate it to the king. As I had the honour to dine with him
	on Thursday last, the 20th of this month, being seated at his side, I told
	him in a whisper that he could, if he liked, humble all the enemies of
	France. He did <a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192"></a>not deny it, but began to smile. In fact, this man is the
	miracle of art. Sometimes he employs the oil and powder mixed, sometimes
	the powder only; but in so small a quantity that, when the lingot which I
	made was rubbed all over with it, it did not shew at all.”</p>

	<p>This soft-headed priest was by no means the only person in the
	neighbourhood who lost his wits in hopes of the boundless wealth held out
	by this clever impostor. Another priest, named De Lions, a chanter in the
	cathedral of Grenoble, writing on the 30th January 1707, says: “M.
	Mesnard, the curate of Montier, has written to me, stating that there is a
	man, about thirty-five years of age, named Delisle, who turns lead and
	iron into gold and silver; and that this transmutation is so veritable and
	so true, that the goldsmiths affirm that his gold and silver are the
	purest and finest they ever saw. For five years this man was looked upon
	as a madman or a cheat; but the public mind is now disabused with respect
	to him. He now resides with M. de la Palu, at the château of the same
	name. M. de la Palu is not very easy in his circumstances, and wants money
	to portion his daughters, who have remained single till middle age, no man
	being willing to take them without a dowry. M. Delisle has promised to
	make them the richest girls in the province before he goes to court,
	having been sent for by the king. He has asked for a little time before
	his departure, in order that he may collect powder enough to make several
	quintals of gold before the eyes of his majesty, to whom he intends to
	present them. The principal matter of his wonderful powder is composed of
	simples, principally the herbs <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lunaria major</em> and <em>minor</em>. There is a
	good deal of the first planted by him in the gardens of La Palu; and he
	gets the other from the mountains that stretch about two leagues from
	Montier. What I tell you now is not a mere story invented for your
	diversion: M. Mesnard can bring forward many witnesses to its truth; among
	others, the Bishop of Senés, who saw these surprising operations
	performed; and M. de Cerisy, whom you know well. Delisle transmutes his
	metals in public. He rubs the lead or iron with his powder, and puts it
	over burning charcoal. In a short time it changes colour; the lead becomes
	yellow, and is found to be converted into excellent gold; the iron becomes
	white, and is found to be pure silver. Delisle is altogether an illiterate
	person. M. de St. Auban endeavoured to teach him to read and write, but he
	profited very little by his lessons. He is unpolite, fantastic, and a
	dreamer, and acts by fits and starts.”</p>

	<p>Delisle, it would appear, was afraid of venturing to Paris. He knew that
	his sleight of hand would be too narrowly watched in the royal presence;
	and upon some pretence or other he delayed the journey for more than two
	years. Desmarets, the Minister of Finance <a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"></a>to Louis XIV., thinking the
	“philosopher” dreaded foul play, twice sent him a safe conduct under the
	king’s seal; but Delisle still refused. Upon this, Desmarets wrote to the
	Bishop of Senés for his real opinion as to these famous transmutations.
	The following was the answer of that prelate:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="salutation">“Copy of a report addressed to M. Desmarets, Comptroller-General
		of the Finances to His Majesty Louis XIV., by the Bishop of Senés,
		dated March 1709.</p>

		<p>“<span class="first_word">Sir</span>,—A twelvemonth ago, or a little more, I expressed to you my joy at
		hearing of your elevation to the ministry; I have now the honour to write
		you my opinion of the Sieur Delisle, who has been working at the
		transmutation of metals in my diocese. I have, during the last two years,
		spoken of him several times to the Count de Pontchartrain, because he
		asked me; but I have not written to you, sir, or to M. de Chamillart,
		because you neither of you requested my opinion upon the subject. Now,
		however, that you have given me to understand that you wish to know my
		sentiments on the matter, I will unfold myself to you in all sincerity,
		for the interests of the king and the glory of your ministry.</p>

		<p>“There are two things about the Sieur Delisle which, in my opinion, should
		be examined without prejudice: the one relates to his secret; the other,
		to his person; that is to say, whether his transmutations are real, and
		whether his conduct has been regular. As regards the secret of the
		philosopher’s stone, I deemed it impossible, for a long time; and for more
		than three years I was more mistrustful of the pretensions of this Sieur
		Delisle than of any other person. During this period I afforded him no
		countenance; I even aided a person, who was highly recommended to me by an
		influential family of this province, to prosecute Delisle for some offence
		or other which it was alleged he had committed. But this person, in his
		anger against him, having told me that he had himself been several times
		the bearer of gold and silver to the goldsmiths of Nice, Aix, and Avignon,
		which had been transmuted by Delisle from lead and iron, I began to waver
		a little in my opinions respecting him. I afterwards met Delisle at the
		house of one of my friends. To please me, the family asked Delisle to
		operate before me, to which he immediately consented. I offered him some
		iron nails, which he changed into silver in the chimney-place before six
		or seven credible witnesses. I took the nails thus transmuted, and sent
		them by my almoner to Imbert, the jeweller of Aix, who, having subjected
		them to the necessary trial, returned them to me, saying they were very
		good silver. Still, however, I was not quite satisfied. M. de
		Pontchartrain having <a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194"></a>hinted to me, two years previously, that I should do
		a thing agreeable to his majesty if I examined into this business of
		Delisle, I resolved to do so now. I therefore summoned the alchymist to
		come to me at Castellane. He came; and I had him escorted by eight or ten
		vigilant men, to whom I had given notice to watch his hands strictly.
		Before all of us he changed two pieces of lead into gold and silver. I
		sent them both to M. de Pontchartrain; and he afterwards informed me by a
		letter, now lying before me, that he had shewn them to the most
		experienced goldsmiths of Paris, who unanimously pronounced them to be
		gold and silver of the very purest quality, and without alloy. My former
		bad opinion of Delisle was now indeed shaken. It was much more so when he
		performed transmutation five or six times before me at Senés, and made me
		perform it myself before him without his putting his hand to any thing.
		You have seen, sir, the letter of my nephew, the Père Berard, of the
		Oratoire at Paris, on the experiment that he performed at Castellane, and
		the truth of which I hereby attest. Another nephew of mine, the Sieur
		Bourget, who was here three weeks ago, performed the same experiment in my
		presence, and will detail all the circumstances to you personally at
		Paris. A hundred persons in my diocese have been witnesses of these
		things. I confess to you, sir, that, after the testimony of so many
		spectators and so many goldsmiths, and after the repeatedly successful
		experiments that I saw performed, all my prejudices vanished. My reason
		was convinced by my eyes; and the phantoms of impossibility which I had
		conjured up were dissipated by the work of my own hands.</p>

		<p>“It now only remains for me to speak to you on the subject of his person
		and conduct. Three suspicions have been excited against him: the first,
		that he was implicated in some criminal proceeding at Cisteron, and that
		he falsified the coin of the realm; the second, that the king sent him two
		safe-conducts without effect; and the third, that he still delays going to
		court to operate before the king. You may see, sir, that I do not hide or
		avoid any thing. As regards the business at Cisteron, the Sieur Delisle
		has repeatedly assured me that there was nothing against him which could
		reasonably draw him within the pale of justice, and that he had never
		carried on any calling injurious to the king’s service. It was true that,
		six or seven years ago, he had been to Cisteron to gather herbs necessary
		for his powder, and that he had lodged at the house of one Pelouse, whom
		he thought an honest man. Pelouse was accused of clipping Louis-d’ors; and
		as he had lodged with him, he was suspected of being his accomplice. This
		mere suspicion, without any proof whatever, had caused him to be condemned
		for contumacy; a common case enough <a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"></a>with judges, who always proceed with
		much rigour against those who are absent. During my own sojourn at Aix, it
		was well known that a man, named André Aluys, had spread about reports
		injurious to the character of Delisle, because he hoped thereby to avoid
		paying him a sum of forty <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis</em> that he owed him. But permit me, sir, to
		go further, and to add that, even if there were well-founded suspicions
		against Delisle, we should look with some little indulgence on the faults
		of a man who possesses a secret so useful to the state. As regards the two
		safe-conducts sent him by the king, I think I can answer certainly that it
		was through no fault of his that he paid so little attention to them. His
		year, strictly speaking, consists only of the four summer months; and when
		by any means he is prevented from making the proper use of them, he loses
		a whole year. Thus the first safe-conduct became useless by the irruption
		of the Duke of Savoy in 1707 and the second had hardly been obtained, at
		the end of June 1708, when the said Delisle was insulted by a party of
		armed men, pretending to act under the authority of the Count de Grignan,
		to whom he wrote several letters of complaint, without receiving any
		answer, or promise that his safety would be attended to. What I have now
		told you, sir, removes the third objection, and is the reason why, at the
		present time, he cannot go to Paris to the king, in fulfilment of his
		promises made two years ago. Two, or even three, summers have been lost to
		him, owing to the continual inquietude he has laboured under. He has, in
		consequence, been unable to work, and has not collected a sufficient
		quantity of his oil and powder, or brought what he has got to the
		necessary degree of perfection. For this reason also he could not give the
		Sieur de Bourget the portion he promised him for your inspection. If the
		other day he changed some lead into gold with a few grains of his powder,
		they were assuredly all he had; for he told me that such was the fact long
		before he knew my nephew was coming. Even if he had preserved this small
		quantity to operate before the king, I am sure that, on second thoughts,
		he would never have adventured with so little; because the slightest
		obstacles in the metals (their being too hard or too soft, which is only
		discovered in operating,) would have caused him to be looked upon as an
		impostor, if, in case his first powder had proved ineffectual, he had not
		been possessed of more to renew the experiment and surmount the
		difficulty.</p>

		<p>“Permit me, sir, in conclusion, to repeat, that such an artist as this
		should not be driven to the last extremity, nor forced to seek an asylum
		offered to him in other countries, but which he has despised, as much from
		his own inclinations as from the advice I have given him. You risk nothing
		in giving him a little time, and in hurrying <a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196"></a>him you may lose a great
		deal. The genuineness of his gold can no longer be doubted, after the
		testimony of so many jewellers of Aix, Lyons, and Paris in its favour. As
		it is not his fault that the previous safe-conducts sent to him have been
		of no service, it will be necessary to send him another; for the success
		of which I will be answerable, if you will confide the matter to me, and
		trust to my zeal for the service of his majesty, to whom I pray you to
		communicate this letter, that I may be spared the just reproaches he might
		one day heap upon me if he remained ignorant of the facts I have now
		written to you. Assure him, if you please, that, if you send me such a
		safe-conduct, I will oblige the Sieur Delisle to depose with me such
		precious pledges of his fidelity as shall enable me to be responsible
		myself to the king. These are my sentiments, and I submit them to your
		superior knowledge; and have the honour to remain, with much respect, &amp;c.</p>

		<p class="sign">“✠ <span class="special_name">John Bishop of Senes</span>.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>That Delisle was no ordinary impostor, but a man of consummate cunning and
	address, is very evident from this letter. The bishop was fairly taken in
	by his clever legerdemain, and when once his first distrust was conquered,
	appeared as anxious to deceive himself as even Delisle could have wished.
	His faith was so abundant that he made the case of his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</em> his own,
	and would not suffer the breath of suspicion to be directed against him.
	Both Louis and his minister appear to have been dazzled by the brilliant
	hopes he had excited, and a third pass, or safe-conduct, was immediately
	sent to the alchymist, with a command from the king that he should
	forthwith present himself at Versailles, and make public trial of his oil
	and powder. But this did not suit the plans of Delisle. In the provinces
	he was regarded as a man of no small importance; the servile flattery that
	awaited him wherever he went was so grateful to his mind that he could not
	willingly relinquish it, and run upon certain detection at the court of
	the monarch. Upon one pretext or another he delayed his journey,
	notwithstanding the earnest solicitations of his good friend the bishop.
	The latter had given his word to the minister, and pledged his honour that
	he would induce Delisle to go, and he began to be alarmed when he found he
	could not subdue the obstinacy of that individual. For more than two years
	he continued to remonstrate with him, and was always met by some excuse,
	that there was not sufficient powder, or that it had not been long enough
	exposed to the rays of the sun. At last his patience was exhausted; and
	fearful that he might suffer in the royal estimation by longer delay, <a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"></a>he
	wrote to the king for a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</em>, in virtue of which the
	alchymist was seized at the castle of La Palu, in the month of June 1711,
	and carried off to be imprisoned in the Bastille.</p>

	<p>The gendarmes were aware that their prisoner was supposed to be the lucky
	possessor of the philosopher’s stone, and on the road they conspired to
	rob and murder him. One of them pretended to be touched with pity for the
	misfortunes of the philosopher, and offered to give him an opportunity of
	escape whenever he could divert the attention of his companions. Delisle
	was profuse in his thanks, little dreaming of the snare that was laid for
	him. His treacherous friend gave notice of the success of the stratagem so
	far; and it was agreed that Delisle should be allowed to struggle with and
	overthrow one of them while the rest were at some distance. They were then
	to pursue him and shoot him through the heart; and after robbing the
	corpse of the philosopher’s stone, convey it to Paris on a cart, and tell
	M. Desmarets that the prisoner had attempted to escape, and would have
	succeeded if they had not fired after him and shot him through the body.
	At a convenient place the scheme was executed. On a given signal from the
	friendly gendarme, Delisle fled, while another gendarme took aim and shot
	him through the thigh. Some peasants arriving at the instant, they were
	prevented from killing him as they intended, and he was transported to
	Paris, maimed and bleeding. He was thrown into a dungeon in the Bastille,
	and obstinately tore away the bandages which the surgeons applied to his
	wound. He never afterwards rose from his bed.</p>

	<p>The Bishop of Senés visited him in prison, and promised him his liberty if
	he would transmute a certain quantity of lead into gold before the king.
	The unhappy man had no longer the means of carrying on the deception; he
	had no gold, and no double-bottomed crucible or hollow wand to conceal it
	in, even if he had. He would not, however, confess that he was an
	impostor; but merely said he did not know how to make the powder of
	projection, but had received a quantity from an Italian philosopher, and
	had used it all in his various transmutations in Provence. He lingered for
	seven or eight months in the Bastille, and died from the effects of his
	wound, in the forty-first year of his age.</p>
	
	<h3 class="alchymist">Albert Aluys.</h3>

	<p>This pretender to the philosopher’s stone was the son, by a former
	husband, of the woman Aluys, with whom Delisle became acquainted at the
	commencement of his career, in the cabaret by the road-side, and whom he
	afterwards married. Delisle performed the part of a father towards him,
	and thought he could shew no stronger proof of <a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"></a>his regard, than by giving
	him the necessary instructions to carry on the deception which had raised
	himself to such a pitch of greatness. The young Aluys was an apt scholar,
	and soon mastered all the jargon of the alchymists. He discoursed
	learnedly upon projections, cimentations, sublimations, the elixir of
	life, and the universal alkahest; and on the death of Delisle gave out
	that the secret of that great adept had been communicated to him, and to
	him only. His mother aided in the fraud, with the hope they might both
	fasten themselves, in the true alchymical fashion, upon some rich dupe,
	who would entertain them magnificently while the operation was in
	progress. The fate of Delisle was no inducement for them to stop in
	France. The Provençals, it is true, entertained as high an opinion as ever
	of his skill, and were well inclined to believe the tales of the young
	adept on whom his mantle had fallen; but the dungeons of the Bastille were
	yawning for their prey, and Aluys and his mother decamped with all
	convenient expedition. They travelled about the Continent for several
	years, sponging upon credulous rich men, and now and then performing
	successful transmutations by the aid of double-bottomed crucibles and the
	like. In the year 1726, Aluys, without his mother, who appears to have
	died in the interval, was at Vienna, where he introduced himself to the
	Duke de Richelieu, at that time ambassador from the court of France. He
	completely deceived this nobleman; he turned lead into gold (apparently)
	on several occasions, and even made the ambassador himself turn an iron
	nail into a silver one. The duke afterwards boasted to Lenglet du Fresnoy
	of his achievements as an alchymist, and regretted that he had not been
	able to discover the secret of the precious powder by which he performed
	them.</p>

	<p>Aluys soon found that, although he might make a dupe of the Duke de
	Richelieu, he could not get any money from him. On the contrary, the duke
	expected all his pokers and fire-shovels to be made silver, and all his
	pewter utensils gold; and thought the honour of his acquaintance was
	reward sufficient for a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roturier</em>, who could not want wealth since he
	possessed so invaluable a secret. Aluys, seeing that so much was expected
	of him, bade adieu to his excellency, and proceeded to Bohemia accompanied
	by a pupil, and by a young girl who had fallen in love with him in Vienna.
	Some noblemen in Bohemia received him kindly, and entertained him at their
	houses for months at a time. It was his usual practice to pretend that he
	possessed only a few grains of his powder, with which he would operate in
	any house where he intended to fix his quarters for the season. He would
	make the proprietor the present of a piece of gold thus transmuted, and
	promise him millions, if he could only be provided with leisure to <a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199"></a>gather
	his <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">lunaria major</em> and <em>minor</em> on their mountain-tops, and board,
	lodging, and loose cash for himself, his wife, and his pupil, in the
	interval.</p>

	<p>He exhausted in this manner the patience of some dozen of people, when,
	thinking that there was less danger for him in France under the young king
	Louis XV. than under his old and morose predecessor, he returned to
	Provence. On his arrival at Aix, he presented himself before M. le Bret,
	the president of the province, a gentleman who was much attached to the
	pursuits of alchymy, and had great hopes of being himself able to find the
	philosopher’s stone. M. le Bret, contrary to his expectation, received him
	very coolly, in consequence of some rumours that were spread abroad
	respecting him; and told him to call upon him on the morrow. Aluys did not
	like the tone of the voice, or the expression of the eye of the learned
	president, as that functionary looked down upon him. Suspecting that all
	was not right, he left Aix secretly the same evening, and proceeded to
	Marseilles. But the police were on the watch for him; and he had not been
	there four-and-twenty hours, before he was arrested on a charge of
	coining, and thrown into prison.</p>

	<p>As the proofs against him were too convincing to leave him much hope of an
	acquittal, he planned an escape from durance. It so happened that the
	gaoler had a pretty daughter, and Aluys soon discovered that she was
	tender-hearted. He endeavoured to gain her in his favour, and succeeded.
	The damsel, unaware that he was a married man, conceived and encouraged a
	passion for him, and generously provided him with the means of escape.
	After he had been nearly a year in prison he succeeded in getting free,
	leaving the poor girl behind to learn that he was already married, and to
	lament in solitude that she had given her heart to an ungrateful vagabond.</p>

	<p>When he left Marseilles, he had not a shoe to his foot or a decent garment
	to his back, but was provided with some money and clothes by his wife in a
	neighbouring town. They then found their way to Brussels, and by dint of
	excessive impudence, brought themselves into notice. He took a house,
	fitted up a splendid laboratory, and gave out that he knew the secret of
	transmutation. In vain did M. Percel, the brother-in-law of Lenglet du
	Fresnoy, who resided in that city, expose his pretensions, and hold him up
	to contempt as an ignorant impostor: the world believed him not. They took
	the alchymist at his word, and besieged his doors to see and wonder at the
	clever legerdemain by which he turned iron nails into gold and silver. A
	rich <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">greffier</em> paid him a large sum of money that he might be instructed
	in the art, and Aluys gave him several lessons on the most common
	principles of chemistry. The greffier studied hard for a twelvemonth, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"></a>then discovered that his master was a quack. He demanded his money back
	again; but Aluys was not inclined to give it him, and the affair was
	brought before the civil tribunal of the province. In the mean time,
	however, the greffier died suddenly; poisoned, according to the popular
	rumour, by his debtor, to avoid repayment. So great an outcry arose in the
	city, that Aluys, who may have been innocent of the crime, was
	nevertheless afraid to remain and brave it. He withdrew secretly in the
	night, and retired to Paris. Here all trace of him is lost. He was never
	heard of again; but Lenglet du Fresnoy conjectures that he ended his days
	in some obscure dungeon, into which he was cast for coining or other
	malpractices.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">The Count de St. Germain.</h3>

	<p>This adventurer was of a higher grade than the last, and played a
	distinguished part at the court of Louis XV. He pretended to have
	discovered the elixir of life, by means of which he could make any one
	live for centuries; and allowed it to believed that his own age was
	upwards of two thousand years. He entertained many of the opinions of the
	Rosicrucians; boasted of his intercourse with sylphs and salamanders; and
	of his power of drawing diamonds from the earth, and pearls from the sea,
	by the force of his incantations. He did not lay claim to the merit of
	having discovered the philosopher’s stone; but devoted so much of his time
	to the operations of alchymy, that it was very generally believed, that if
	such a thing as the philosopher’s stone had ever existed, or could be
	called into existence, he was the man to succeed in finding it.</p>

	<p>It has never yet been discovered what was his real name, or in what
	country he was born. Some believed, from the Jewish cast of his handsome
	countenance, that he was the “wandering Jew;” others asserted that he was
	the issue of an Arabian princess, and that his father was a salamander;
	while others, more reasonable, affirmed him to be the son of a Portuguese
	Jew established at Bourdeaux. He first carried on his imposture in
	Germany, where he made considerable sums by selling an elixir to arrest
	the progress of old age. The Maréchal de Belle-Isle purchased a dose of
	it; and was so captivated with the wit, learning, and good manners of the
	charlatan, and so convinced of the justice of his most preposterous
	pretensions, that he induced him to fix his residence in Paris. Under the
	marshal’s patronage, he first appeared in the gay circles of that capital.
	Every one was delighted with the mysterious stranger; who, at this period
	of his life, appears to have been about seventy years of age, but did not
	look more than forty-five. His easy assurance imposed upon most <a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201"></a>people.
	His reading was extensive, and his memory extraordinarily tenacious of the
	slightest circumstances. His pretension to have lived for so many
	centuries naturally exposed him to some puzzling questions, as to the
	appearance, life, and conversation of the great men of former days; but he
	was never at a loss for an answer. Many who questioned him for the purpose
	of scoffing at him, refrained in perplexity, quite bewildered by his
	presence of mind, his ready replies, and his astonishing accuracy on every
	point mentioned in history. To increase the mystery by which he was
	surrounded, he permitted no person to know how he lived. He dressed in a
	style of the greatest magnificence; sported valuable diamonds in his hat,
	on his fingers, and in his shoe-buckles; and sometimes made the most
	costly presents to the ladies of the court. It was suspected by many that
	he was a spy, in the pay of the English ministry; but there never was a
	tittle of evidence to support the charge. The king looked upon him with
	marked favour, was often closeted with him for hours together, and would
	not suffer any body to speak disparagingly of him. Voltaire constantly
	turned him into ridicule; and, in one of his letters to the King of
	Prussia, mentions him as “un comte pour rire;” and states that he
	pretended to have dined with the holy fathers at the Council of Trent!</p>

	<p>In the <cite>Memoirs of Madame du Hausset</cite>, chamber-woman to Madame du
	Pompadour, there are some amusing anecdotes of this personage. Very soon
	after his arrival in Paris, he had the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</em> of her dressing-room; a
	favour only granted to the most powerful lords at the court of her royal
	lover. Madame was fond of conversing with him; and, in her presence, he
	thought fit to lower his pretensions very considerably; but he often
	allowed her to believe that he had lived two or three hundred years at
	least. “One day,” says Madame du Hausset, “madame said to him, in my
	presence, ‘What was the personal appearance of Francis I.? He was a king I
	should have liked.’ ‘He was, indeed, very captivating,’ replied St.
	Germain; and he proceeded to describe his face and person, as that of a
	man whom he had accurately observed. ‘It is a pity he was too ardent. I
	could have given him some good advice, which would have saved him from all
	his misfortunes: but he would not have followed it; for it seems as if a
	fatality attended princes, forcing them to shut their ears to the wisest
	counsel.’ ‘Was his court very brilliant?’ inquired Madame du Pompadour.
	‘Very,’ replied the count; ‘but those of his grandsons surpassed it. In
	the time of Mary Stuart and Margaret of Valois, it was a land of
	enchantment—a temple sacred to pleasures of every kind.’ Madame said,
	laughing, ‘You seem to have seen all this.’ ‘I have an excellent memory,’
	said he, ‘and have read the history of France <a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202"></a>with great care. I sometimes
	amuse myself, not by making, but by letting, it be believed that I lived
	in old times.’</p>


		<p>“‘But you do not tell us your age,’ said Madame du Pompadour to him on
		another occasion; ‘and yet you pretend you are very old. The Countess de
		Gergy, who was, I believe, ambassadress at Vienna some fifty years ago,
		says she saw you there, exactly the same as you now appear.’</p>

		<p>“‘It is true, madame,’ replied St. Germain; ‘I knew Madame de Gergy many
		years ago.’</p>

		<p>“‘But, according to her account, you must be more than a hundred years
		old?’</p>

		<p>“‘That is not impossible,’ said he, laughing; ‘but it is much more
		possible that the good lady is in her dotage.’</p>

		<p>“‘You gave her an elixir, surprising for the effects it produced; for she
		says, that during a length of time, she only appeared to be eighty-four;
		the age at which she took it. Why don’t you give it to the king?’</p>

		<p>“‘Oh, madam,’ he exclaimed, ‘the physicians would have me broken on the
		wheel, were I to think of drugging his majesty.’”</p>
	

	<p>When the world begins to believe extraordinary things of an individual,
	there is no telling where its extravagance will stop. People, when once
	they have taken the start, vie with each other who shall believe most. At
	this period all Paris resounded with the wonderful adventures of the Count
	de St. Germain; and a company of waggish young men tried the following
	experiment upon its credulity: A clever mimic, who, on account of the
	amusement he afforded, was admitted into good society, was taken by them,
	dressed as the Count de St. Germain, into several houses in the Rue du
	Marais. He imitated the count’s peculiarities admirably, and found his
	auditors open-mouthed to believe any absurdity he chose to utter. No
	fiction was too monstrous for their all-devouring credulity. He spoke of
	the Saviour of the world in terms of the greatest familiarity; said he had
	supped with him at the marriage in Canaan of Galilee, where the water was
	miraculously turned into wine. In fact, he said he was an intimate friend
	of his, and had often warned him to be less romantic and imprudent, or he
	would finish his career miserably. This infamous blasphemy, strange to
	say, found believers; and ere three days had elapsed, it was currently
	reported that St. Germain was born soon after the deluge, and that he
	would never die!</p>

	<p>St. Germain himself was too much a man of the world to assert any thing so
	monstrous; but he took no pains to contradict the story. In all his
	conversations with persons of rank and education, he advanced his claims
	modestly, and as if by mere inadvertency, and seldom <a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"></a>pretended to a
	longevity beyond three hundred years, except when he found he was in
	company with persons who would believe any thing. He often spoke of Henry
	VIII. as if he had known him intimately, and of the Emperor Charles V. as
	if that monarch had delighted in his society. He would describe
	conversations which took place with such an apparent truthfulness, and be
	so exceedingly minute and particular as to the dress and appearance of the
	individuals, and even the weather at the time and the furniture of the
	room, that three persons out of four were generally inclined to credit
	him. He had constant applications from rich old women for an elixir to
	make them young again, and it would appear gained large sums in this
	manner. To those whom he was pleased to call his friends he said his mode
	of living and plan of diet were far superior to any elixir, and that any
	body might attain a patriarchal age by refraining from drinking at meals,
	and very sparingly at any other time. The Baron de Gleichen followed this
	system, and took great quantities of senna leaves, expecting to live for
	two hundred years. He died, however, at seventy-three. The Duchess de
	Choiseul was desirous of following the same system, but the duke her
	husband in much wrath forbade her to follow any system prescribed by a man
	who had so equivocal a reputation as M. de St. Germain.</p>

	<p>Madame du Hausset says she saw St. Germain and conversed with him several
	times. He appeared to her to be about fifty years of age, was of the
	middle size, and had fine expressive features. His dress was always
	simple, but displayed much taste. He usually wore diamond rings of great
	value, and his watch and snuff-box were ornamented with a profusion of
	precious stones. One day, at Madame du Pompadour’s apartments, where the
	principal courtiers were assembled, St. Germain made his appearance in
	diamond knee and shoe buckles of so fine a water, that madame said she did
	not think the king had any equal to them. He was entreated to pass into
	the antechamber and undo them, which he did, and brought them to madame
	for closer inspection. M. de Gontant, who was present, said their value
	could not be less than two hundred thousand livres, or upwards of eight
	thousand pounds sterling. The Baron de Gleichen, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, relates
	that the count one day shewed him so many diamonds, that he thought he saw
	before him all the treasures of Aladdin’s lamp; and adds, that he had had
	great experience in precious stones, and was convinced that all those
	possessed by the count were genuine. On another occasion St. Germain
	shewed Madame du Pompadour a small box, containing topazes, emeralds, and
	diamonds worth half a million of livres. He affected to despise all this
	wealth, to make the world more easily believe that he could, like the
	Rosicrucians, <a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"></a>draw precious stones out of the earth by the magic of his
	song. He gave away a great number of these jewels to the ladies of the
	court; and Madame du Pompadour was so charmed with his generosity, that
	she gave him a richly enamelled snuff-box as a token of her regard, on the
	lid of which was beautifully painted a portrait of Socrates, or some other
	Greek sage, to whom she compared him. He was not only lavish to the
	mistresses, but to the maids. Madame du Hausset says: “The count came to
	see Madame du Pompadour, who was very ill, and lay on the sofa. He shewed
	her diamonds enough to furnish a king’s treasury. Madame sent for me to
	see all those beautiful things. I looked at them with an air of the utmost
	astonishment; but I made signs to her that I thought them all false. The
	count felt for something in a pocket-book about twice as large as a
	spectacle-case, and at length drew out two or three little paper packets,
	which he unfolded, and exhibited a superb ruby. He threw on the table,
	with a contemptuous air, a little cross of green and white stones. I
	looked at it, and said it was not to be despised. I then put it on, and
	admired it greatly. The count begged me to accept it; I refused. He urged
	me to take it. At length he pressed so warmly, that madame, seeing it
	could not be worth more than a thousand livres, made me a sign to accept
	it. I took the cross, much pleased with the count’s politeness.”</p>

	<p>How the adventurer obtained his wealth remains a secret. He could not have
	made it all by the sale of his <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em> in Germany, though no doubt
	some portion of it was derived from that source. Voltaire positively says
	he was in the pay of foreign governments; and in his letter to the King of
	Prussia, dated the 5th of April 1758, says that he was initiated in all
	the secrets of Choiseul, Kaunitz, and Pitt. Of what use he could be to any
	of those ministers, and to Choiseul especially, is a mystery of mysteries.</p>

	<p>There appears no doubt that he possessed the secret of removing spots from
	diamonds; and in all probability he gained considerable sums by buying at
	inferior prices such as had flaws in them, and afterwards disposing of
	them at a profit of cent per cent. Madame du Hausset relates the following
	anecdote on this particular: “The king,” says she, “ordered a
	middling-sized diamond, which had a flaw in it, to be brought to him.
	After having it weighed, his majesty said to the count, ‘The value of this
	diamond as it is, and with the flaw in it, is six thousand livres; without
	the flaw, it would be worth at least ten thousand. Will you undertake to
	make me a gainer of four thousand livres?’ St. Germain examined it very
	attentively, and said, ‘It is possible; it may be done. I will bring it
	you again in a month.’ At the time appointed the count brought back the
	diamond <a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205"></a>without a spot, and gave it to the king. It was wrapped in a cloth
	of amianthos, which he took off. The king had it weighed immediately, and
	found it very little diminished. His majesty then sent it to his jeweller
	by M. de Gontant, without telling him of any thing that had passed. The
	jeweller gave nine thousand six hundred livres for it. The king, however,
	sent for the diamond back again, and said he would keep it as a curiosity.
	He could not overcome his surprise, and said M. de St. Germain must be
	worth millions, especially if he possessed the secret of making large
	diamonds out of small ones. The count neither said that he could or could
	not, but positively asserted that he knew how to make pearls grow, and
	give them the finest water. The king paid him great attention, and so did
	Madame du Pompadour. M. du Quesnoy once said that St. Germain was a quack,
	but the king reprimanded him. In fact, his majesty appears infatuated by
	him, and sometimes talks of him as if his descent were illustrious.”</p>

	<p>St. Germain had a most amusing vagabond for a servant, to whom he would
	often appeal for corroboration, when relating some wonderful event that
	happened centuries before. The fellow, who was not without ability,
	generally corroborated him in a most satisfactory manner. Upon one
	occasion, his master was telling a party of ladies and gentlemen, at
	dinner, some conversation he had had in Palestine with King Richard I. of
	England, whom he described as a very particular friend of his. Signs of
	astonishment and incredulity were visible on the faces of the company;
	upon which St. Germain very coolly turned to his servant, who stood behind
	his chair, and asked him if he had not spoken truth? “I really cannot
	say,” replied the man, without moving a muscle; “you forget, sir, I have
	only been five hundred years in your service!” “Ah! true,” said his
	master; “I remember now; it was a little before your time!”</p>

	<p>Occasionally, when with men whom he could not so easily dupe, he gave
	utterance to the contempt with which he could scarcely avoid regarding
	such gaping credulity. “These fools of Parisians,” said he to the Baron de
	Gleichen, “believe me to be more than five hundred years old; and, since
	they will have it so, I confirm them in their idea. Not but that I really
	am much older than I appear.”</p>

	<p>Many other stories are related of this strange impostor; but enough have
	been quoted to shew his character and pretensions. It appears that he
	endeavoured to find the philosopher’s stone; but never boasted of
	possessing it. The Prince of Hesse Cassel, whom he had known years before,
	in Germany, wrote urgent letters to him, entreating him to quit Paris, and
	reside with him. St. Germain at last consented. Nothing further is known
	of his career. There were no <a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"></a>gossipping memoir-writers at the court of
	Hesse Cassel to chronicle his sayings and doings. He died at Sleswig,
	under the roof of his friend the prince, in the year 1784.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Cagliostro.</h3>

	<p>This famous charlatan, the friend and successor of St. Germain, ran a
	career still more extraordinary. He was the arch-quack of his age, the
	last of the great pretenders to the philosopher’s stone and the water of
	life, and during his brief season of prosperity, one of the most
	conspicuous characters of Europe.</p>

	<p>His real name was Joseph Balsamo. He was born at Palermo, about the year
	1743, of humble parentage. He had the misfortune to lose his father during
	his infancy, and his education was left in consequence to some relatives
	of his mother, the latter being too poor to afford him any instruction
	beyond mere reading and writing. He was sent in his fifteenth year to a
	monastery, to be taught the elements of chemistry and physic; but his
	temper was so impetuous, his indolence so invincible, and his vicious
	habits so deeply rooted, that he made no progress. After remaining some
	years, he left it with the character of an uninformed and dissipated young
	man, with good natural talents but a bad disposition. When he became of
	age, he abandoned himself to a life of riot and debauchery, and entered
	himself, in fact, into that celebrated fraternity, known in France and
	Italy as the “Knights of Industry,” and in England as the “Swell Mob.” He
	was far from being an idle or unwilling member of the corps. The first way
	in which he distinguished himself was by forging orders of admission to
	the theatres. He afterwards robbed his uncle, and counterfeited a will.
	For acts like these, he paid frequent compulsory visits to the prisons of
	Palermo. Somehow or other he acquired the character of a sorcerer—of a
	man who had failed in discovering the secrets of alchymy, and had sold his
	soul to the devil for the gold which he was not able to make by means of
	transmutation. He took no pains to disabuse the popular mind on this
	particular, but rather encouraged the belief than otherwise. He at last
	made use of it to cheat a silversmith named Marano, of about sixty ounces
	of gold, and was in consequence obliged to leave Palermo. He persuaded
	this man that he could shew him a treasure hidden in a cave, for which
	service he was to receive the sixty ounces of gold, while the silversmith
	was to have all the treasure for the mere trouble of digging it up. They
	went together at midnight to an excavation in the vicinity of Palermo,
	where Balsamo drew a magic circle, and invoked the devil to shew his
	treasures. Suddenly there appeared half a dozen fellows, the accomplices
	of the swindler, dressed to represent <a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"></a>devils, with horns on their heads,
	claws to their fingers, and vomiting apparently red and blue flame. They
	were armed with pitchforks, with which they belaboured poor Marano till he
	was almost dead, and robbed him of his sixty ounces of gold and all the
	valuables he carried about his person. They then made off, accompanied by
	Balsamo, leaving the unlucky silversmith to recover or die at his leisure.
	Nature chose the former course; and soon after daylight he was restored to
	his senses, smarting in body from his blows and in spirit for the
	deception of which he had been the victim. His first impulse was to
	denounce Balsamo to the magistrates of the town; but on further reflection
	he was afraid of the ridicule that a full exposure of all the
	circumstances would draw upon him; he therefore took the truly Italian
	resolution of being revenged on Balsamo, by murdering him at the first
	convenient opportunity. Having given utterance to this threat in the
	hearing of a friend of Balsamo, it was reported to the latter, who
	immediately packed up his valuables and quitted Europe.</p>

	<p>He chose Medina, in Arabia, for his future dwelling-place, and there
	became acquainted with a Greek named Altotas, a man exceedingly well
	versed in all the languages of the East, and an indefatigable student of
	alchymy. He possessed an invaluable collection of Arabian manuscripts on
	his favourite science, and studied them with such unremitting industry
	that he found he had not sufficient time to attend to his crucibles and
	furnaces without neglecting his books. He was looking about for an
	assistant when Balsamo opportunely presented himself, and made so
	favourable an impression that he was at once engaged in that capacity. But
	the relation of master and servant did not long subsist between them;
	Balsamo was too ambitious and too clever to play a secondary part, and
	within fifteen days of their first acquaintance they were bound together
	as friends and partners. Altotas, in the course of a long life devoted to
	alchymy, had stumbled upon some valuable discoveries in chemistry, one of
	which was an ingredient for improving the manufacture of flax, and
	imparting to goods of that material a gloss and softness almost equal to
	silk. Balsamo gave him the good advice to leave the philosopher’s stone
	for the present undiscovered, and make gold out of their flax. The advice
	was taken, and they proceeded together to Alexandria to trade, with a
	large stock of that article. They stayed forty days in Alexandria, and
	gained a considerable sum by their venture. They afterwards visited other
	cities in Egypt, and were equally successful. They also visited Turkey,
	where they sold drugs and amulets. On their return to Europe, they were
	driven by stress of weather into Malta, and were hospitably received by
	Pinto, the Grand Master of the <a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"></a>Knights, and a famous alchymist. They
	worked in his laboratory for some months, and tried hard to change a
	pewter platter into a silver one. Balsamo, having less faith than his
	companions, was sooner wearied; and obtaining from his host many letters
	of introduction to Rome and Naples, he left him and Altotas to find the
	philosopher’s stone and transmute the pewter platter without him.</p>

	<p>He had long since dropped the name of Balsamo on account of the many ugly
	associations that clung to it; and during his travels had assumed at least
	half a score others, with titles annexed to them. He called himself
	sometimes the Chevalier de Fischio, the Marquis de Melissa, the Baron de
	Belmonte, de Pelligrini, d’Anna, de Fenix, de Harat, but most commonly the
	Count de Cagliostro. Under the latter title he entered Rome, and never
	afterwards changed it. In this city he gave himself out as the restorer of
	the Rosicrucian philosophy; said he could transmute all metals into gold;
	that he could render himself invisible, cure all diseases, and administer
	an elixir against old age and decay. His letters from the Grand Master
	Pinto procured him an introduction into the best families. He made money
	rapidly by the sale of his <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em>; and, like other quacks,
	performed many remarkable cures by inspiring his patients with the most
	complete faith and reliance upon his powers; an advantage which the most
	impudent charlatans often possess over the regular practitioner.</p>

	<p>While thus in a fair way of making his fortune he became acquainted with
	the beautiful Lorenza Feliciana, a young lady of noble birth, but without
	fortune. Cagliostro soon discovered that she possessed accomplishments
	that were invaluable. Besides her ravishing beauty, she had the readiest
	wit, the most engaging manners, the most fertile imagination, and the
	least principle of any of the maidens of Rome. She was just the wife for
	Cagliostro, who proposed himself to her, and was accepted. After their
	marriage, he instructed his fair Lorenza in all the secrets of his
	calling—taught her pretty lips to invoke angels, and genii, sylphs,
	salamanders, and undines, and, when need required, devils and evil
	spirits. Lorenza was an apt scholar; she soon learned all the jargon of
	the alchymists and all the spells of the enchanters; and thus accomplished
	the hopeful pair set out on their travels, to levy contributions on the
	superstitious and the credulous.</p>

	<p>They first went to Sleswig on a visit to the Count de St. Germain, their
	great predecessor in the art of making dupes, and were received by him in
	the most magnificent manner. They no doubt fortified their minds for the
	career they had chosen by the sage discourse of that worshipful gentleman;
	for immediately after they left him, they <a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"></a>began their operations. They
	travelled for three or four years in Russia, Poland, and Germany,
	transmuting metals, telling fortunes, raising spirits, and selling the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</em> wherever they went; but there is no record of their doings
	from whence to draw a more particular detail. It was not until they made
	their appearance in England in 1776, that the names of the Count and
	Countess di Cagliostro began to acquire a European reputation. They
	arrived in London in the July of that year, possessed of property, in
	plate, jewels, and specie, to the amount of about three thousand pounds.
	They hired apartments in Whitcombe Street, and lived for some months
	quietly. In the same house there lodged a Portuguese woman, named Blavary,
	who, being in necessitous circumstances, was engaged by the count as
	interpreter. She was constantly admitted into his laboratory, where he
	spent much of his time in search of the philosopher’s stone. She spread
	abroad the fame of her entertainer in return for his hospitality, and
	laboured hard to impress every body with as full a belief in his
	extraordinary powers as she felt herself; but as a female interpreter of
	the rank and appearance of Madame Blavary did not exactly correspond with
	the count’s notions either of dignity or decorum, he hired a person named
	Vitellini, a teacher of languages, to act in that capacity. Vitellini was
	a desperate gambler, a man who had tried almost every resource to repair
	his ruined fortunes, including among the rest the search for the
	philosopher’s stone. Immediately that he saw the count’s operations, he
	was convinced that the great secret was his, and that the golden gates of
	the palace of fortune were open to let him in. With still more enthusiasm
	than Madame Blavary, he held forth to his acquaintance, and in all public
	places, that the count was an extraordinary man, a true adept, whose
	fortune was immense, and who could transmute into pure and solid gold as
	much lead, iron, and copper as he pleased. The consequence was, that the
	house of Cagliostro was besieged by crowds of the idle, the credulous, and
	the avaricious, all eager to obtain a sight of the “philosopher,” or to
	share in the boundless wealth which he could call into existence.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately for Cagliostro, he had fallen into evil hands. Instead of
	duping the people of England, as he might have done, he became himself the
	victim of a gang of swindlers, who, with the fullest reliance on his
	occult powers, only sought to make money of him. Vitellini introduced to
	him a ruined gambler like himself, named Scot, whom he represented as a
	Scottish nobleman, attracted to London solely by his desire to see and
	converse with the extraordinary man whose fame had spread to the distant
	mountains of the north. Cagliostro received him with great kindness and
	cordiality; and “Lord” Scot thereupon introduced a woman named Fry as Lady
	Scot, <a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210"></a>who was to act as chaperone to the Countess di Cagliostro, and make
	her acquainted with all the noble families of Britain. Thus things went
	swimmingly. “His lordship,” whose effects had not arrived from Scotland,
	and who had no banker in London, borrowed two hundred pounds of the count.
	They were lent without scruple, so flattered was Cagliostro by the
	attentions they paid him, the respect, nay veneration they pretended to
	feel for him, and the complete deference with which they listened to every
	word that fell from his lips.</p>

	<p>Superstitious like all desperate gamesters, Scot had often tried magical
	and cabalistic numbers, in the hope of discovering lucky numbers in the
	lottery or at the roulette-tables. He had in his possession a cabalistic
	manuscript, containing various arithmetical combinations of the kind,
	which he submitted to Cagliostro, with an urgent request that he would
	select a number. Cagliostro took the manuscript and studied it, but, as he
	himself informs us, with no confidence in its truth. He, however,
	predicted twenty as the successful number for the 6th of November
	following. Scot ventured a small sum upon this number out of the two
	hundred pounds he had borrowed, and won. Cagliostro, incited by this
	success, prognosticated number twenty-five for the next drawing. Scot
	tried again, and won a hundred guineas. The numbers fifty-five and
	fifty-seven were announced with equal success for the 18th of the same
	month, to the no small astonishment and delight of Cagliostro, who
	thereupon resolved to try fortune for himself, and not for others. To all
	the entreaties of Scot and his lady that he would predict more numbers for
	them, he turned a deaf ear, even while he still thought him a lord and a
	man of honour; but when he discovered that he was a mere swindler, and the
	pretended Lady Scot an artful woman of the town, he closed his door upon
	them and on all their gang.</p>

	<p>Having complete faith in the supernatural powers of the count, they were
	in the deepest distress at having lost his countenance. They tried by
	every means their ingenuity could suggest to propitiate him again. They
	implored, they threatened, and endeavoured to bribe him; but all was vain.
	Cagliostro would neither see nor correspond with them. In the mean time
	they lived extravagantly, and in the hope of future, exhausted all their
	present gains. They were reduced to the last extremity, when Miss Fry
	obtained access to the countess, and received a guinea from her on the
	representation that she was starving. Miss Fry, not contented with this,
	begged her to intercede with her husband, that for the last time he would
	point out a lucky number in the lottery. The countess promised to exert
	her influence; and Cagliostro, thus entreated, named the number eight, at
	the same time reiterating his determination to have no more to do with any
	of <a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"></a>them. By an extraordinary hazard, which filled Cagliostro with surprise
	and pleasure, number eight was the greatest prize in the lottery. Miss Fry
	and her associates cleared fifteen hundred guineas by the adventure, and
	became more than ever convinced of the occult powers of Cagliostro, and
	strengthened in their determination never to quit him until they had made
	their fortunes. Out of the proceeds Miss Fry bought a handsome necklace at
	a pawnbroker’s for ninety guineas. She then ordered a richly-chased gold
	box, having two compartments, to be made at a jeweller’s, and putting the
	necklace in the one, filled the other with a fine aromatic snuff. She then
	sought another interview with Madame di Cagliostro, and urged her to
	accept the box as a small token of her esteem and gratitude, without
	mentioning the valuable necklace that was concealed in it. Madame di
	Cagliostro accepted the present, and was from that hour exposed to the
	most incessant persecution from all the confederates—Blavary, Vitellini,
	and the pretended Lord and Lady Scot. They flattered themselves they had
	regained their lost footing in the house, and came day after day to know
	lucky numbers in the lottery, sometimes forcing themselves up the stairs,
	and into the count’s laboratory, in spite of the efforts of the servants
	to prevent them. Cagliostro, exasperated at their pertinacity, threatened
	to call in the assistance of the magistrates, and taking Miss Fry by the
	shoulders, pushed her into the street.</p>

	<p>From that time may be dated the misfortunes of Cagliostro. Miss Fry, at
	the instigation of her paramour, determined on vengeance. Her first act
	was to swear a debt of two hundred pounds against Cagliostro, and to cause
	him to be arrested for that sum. While he was in custody in a
	sponging-house, Scot, accompanied by a low attorney, broke into his
	laboratory, and carried off a small box, containing, as they believed, the
	powder of transmutation, and a number of cabalistic manuscripts and
	treatises upon alchymy. They also brought an action against him for the
	recovery of the necklace; and Miss Fry accused both him and his countess
	of sorcery and witchcraft, and of foretelling numbers in the lottery by
	the aid of the Devil. This latter charge was actually heard before Mr.
	Justice Miller. The action of trover for the necklace was tried before the
	Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who recommended the parties to
	submit to arbitration. In the mean time Cagliostro remained in prison for
	several weeks, till having procured bail, he was liberated. He was soon
	after waited upon by an attorney named Reynolds, also deep in the plot,
	who offered to compromise all the actions upon certain conditions. Scot,
	who had accompanied him, concealed himself behind the door, and suddenly
	rushing out, presented a pistol at the heart of Cagliostro, swearing he
	would shoot him instantly, if he <a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"></a>would not tell him truly the art of
	predicting lucky numbers and of transmuting metals. Reynolds pretending to
	be very angry, disarmed his accomplice, and entreated the count to satisfy
	them by fair means, and disclose his secrets, promising that if he would
	do so, they would discharge all the actions, and offer him no further
	molestation. Cagliostro replied, that threats and entreaties were alike
	useless; that he knew no secrets; and that the powder of transmutation of
	which they had robbed him, was of no value to any body but himself. He
	offered, however, if they would discharge the actions, and return the
	powder and the manuscripts, to forgive them all the money they had
	swindled him out of. These conditions were refused; and Scot and Reynolds
	departed, swearing vengeance against him.</p>

	<p>Cagliostro appears to have been quite ignorant of the forms of law in
	England, and to have been without a friend to advise him as to the best
	course he should pursue. While he was conversing with his countess on the
	difficulties that beset them, one of his bail called, and invited him to
	ride in a hackney coach to the house of a person who would see him
	righted. Cagliostro consented, and was driven to the King’s Bench prison,
	where his friend left him. He did not discover for several hours that he
	was a prisoner, or, in fact, understand the process of being surrendered
	by one’s bail.</p>

	<p>He regained his liberty in a few weeks; and the arbitrators between him
	and Miss Fry made their award against him. He was ordered to pay the two
	hundred pounds she had sworn against him, and to restore the necklace and
	gold box which had been presented to the countess. Cagliostro was so
	disgusted, that he determined to quit England. His pretensions, besides,
	had been unmercifully exposed by a Frenchman, named Morande, the editor of
	the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courrier de l’Europe</cite>, published in London. To add to his distress,
	he was recognised in Westminster Hall as Joseph Balsamo, the swindler of
	Palermo. Such a complication of disgrace was not to be borne. He and his
	countess packed up their small effects, and left England with no more than
	fifty pounds, out of the three thousand they had brought with them.</p>

	<p>They first proceeded to Brussels, where fortune was more auspicious. They
	sold considerable quantities of the elixir of life, performed many cures,
	and recruited their finances. They then took their course through Germany
	to Russia, and always with the same success. Gold flowed into their
	coffers faster than they could count it. They quite forgot all the woes
	they had endured in England, and learned to be more circumspect in the
	choice of their acquaintance.</p>

	<p>In the year 1780, they made their appearance in Strasbourg. <a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"></a>Their fame had
	reached that city before them. They took a magnificent hotel, and invited
	all the principal persons of the place to their table. Their wealth
	appeared to be boundless, and their hospitality equal to it. Both the
	count and countess acted as physicians, and gave money, advice, and
	medicine to all the necessitous and suffering of the town. Many of the
	cures they performed astonished those regular practitioners who did not
	make sufficient allowance for the wonderful influence of imagination in
	certain cases. The countess, who at this time was not more than
	five-and-twenty, and all radiant with grace, beauty, and cheerfulness,
	spoke openly of her eldest son as a fine young man of eight-and-twenty,
	who had been for some years a captain in the Dutch service. The trick
	succeeded to admiration. All the ugly old women in Strasbourg, and for
	miles around, thronged the saloon of the countess to purchase the liquid
	which was to make them as blooming as their daughters; the young women
	came in equal abundance, that they might preserve their charms, and when
	twice as old as Ninon de l’Enclos, be more captivating than she; while men
	were not wanting who were fools enough to imagine that they might keep off
	the inevitable stroke of the grim foe by a few drops of the same
	incomparable elixir. The countess, sooth to say, looked like an
	incarnation of immortal loveliness, a very goddess of youth and beauty;
	and it is possible that the crowds of young men and old, who at all
	convenient seasons haunted the perfumed chambers of this enchantress, were
	attracted less by their belief in her occult powers than from admiration
	of her languishing bright eyes and sparkling conversation. But amid all
	the incense that was offered at her shrine, Madame di Cagliostro was ever
	faithful to her spouse. She encouraged hopes, it is true, but she never
	realised them; she excited admiration, yet kept it within bounds; and made
	men her slaves, without ever granting a favour of which the vainest might
	boast.</p>

	<p>In this city they made the acquaintance of many eminent persons, and,
	among others, of the Cardinal Prince de Rohan, who was destined afterwards
	to exercise so untoward an influence over their fate. The cardinal, who
	seems to have had great faith in him as a philosopher, persuaded him to
	visit Paris in his company, which he did, but remained only thirteen days.
	He preferred the society of Strasbourg, and returned thither with the
	intention of fixing his residence far from the capital. But he soon found
	that the first excitement of his arrival had passed away. People began to
	reason with themselves, and to be ashamed of their own admiration. The
	populace, among whom he had lavished his charity with a bountiful hand,
	accused him of being the Antichrist, the Wandering Jew, the man of
	fourteen hundred years of age, a demon in human shape, sent to <a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"></a>lure the
	ignorant to their destruction; while the more opulent and better informed
	called him a spy in the pay of foreign governments, an agent of the
	police, a swindler, and a man of evil life. The outcry grew at last so
	strong, that he deemed it prudent to try his fortune elsewhere.</p>

	<p>He went first to Naples, but that city was too near Palermo; he dreaded
	recognition from some of his early friends, and, after a short stay,
	returned to France. He chose Bourdeaux as his next dwelling-place, and
	created as great a sensation there as he had done in Strasbourg. He
	announced himself as the founder of a new school of medicine and
	philosophy, boasted of his ability to cure all diseases, and invited the
	poor and suffering to visit him, and he would relieve the distress of the
	one class, and cure the ailings of the other. All day long the street
	opposite his magnificent hotel was crowded by the populace; the halt and
	the blind, women with sick babes in their arms, and persons suffering
	under every species of human infirmity, flocked to this wonderful doctor.
	The relief he afforded in money more than counterbalanced the failure of
	his nostrums; and the affluence of people from all the surrounding country
	became so great, that the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jurats</em> of the city granted him a military
	guard, to be stationed day and night before his door, to keep order. The
	anticipations of Cagliostro were realised. The rich were struck with
	admiration of his charity and benevolence, and impressed with a full
	conviction of his marvellous powers. The sale of the elixir went on
	admirably. His saloons were thronged with wealthy dupes who came to
	purchase immortality. Beauty, that would endure for centuries, was the
	attraction for the fair sex; health and strength for the same period were
	the baits held out to the other. His charming countess, in the meantime,
	brought grist to the mill by telling fortunes and casting nativities, or
	granting attendant sylphs to any ladies who would pay sufficiently for
	their services. What was still better, as tending to keep up the credit of
	her husband, she gave the most magnificent parties in Bourdeaux.</p>

	<p>But as at Strasbourg, the popular delusion lasted for a few months only,
	and burned itself out; Cagliostro forgot, in the intoxication of success,
	that there was a limit to quackery which once passed inspired distrust.
	When he pretended to call spirits from the tomb, people became
	incredulous. He was accused of being an enemy to religion, of denying
	Christ, and of being the Wandering Jew. He despised these rumours as long
	as they were confined to a few; but when they spread over the town, when
	he received no more fees, when his parties were abandoned, and his
	acquaintance turned away when they met him in the street, he thought it
	high time to shift his quarters.</p>

	</div>

	<p>He was by this time wearied of the provinces, and turned his thoughts to
	the capital. On his arrival he announced himself as the restorer of
	Egyptian Freemasonry, and the founder of a new philosophy. He immediately
	made his way into the best society by means of his friend the Cardinal de
	Rohan. His success as a magician was quite extraordinary: the most
	considerable persons of the time visited him. He boasted of being able,
	like the Rosicrucians, to converse with the elementary spirits; to invoke
	the mighty dead from the grave, to transmute metals, and to discover
	occult things by means of the special protection of God towards him. Like
	Dr. Dee, he summoned the angels to reveal the future; and they appeared
	and conversed with him in crystals and under glass bells.<a href="#fn48" id="fnm48" title="See the Abbé Fiard..." class="fnmarker">48</a> “There was
	hardly,” says the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie des Contemporains</cite>, “a fine lady in Paris
	who would not sup with the shade of Lucretius in the apartments of
	Cagliostro; a military officer who would not discuss the art of war with
	Cæsar, Hannibal, or Alexander; or an advocate or counsellor who would not
	argue legal points with the ghost of Cicero.” These interviews with the
	departed were very expensive; for, as Cagliostro <a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216"></a>said, the dead would not
	rise for nothing. The countess, as usual, exercised all her ingenuity to
	support her husband’s credit. She was a great favourite with her own sex,
	to many a delighted and wondering auditory of whom she detailed the
	marvellous powers of Cagliostro. She said he could render himself
	invisible, traverse the world with the rapidity of thought, and be in
	several places at the same time.<a href="#fn49" id="fnm49" title="Biographie des Contemporains..." class="fnmarker">49</a></p>

	<p>He had not been long at Paris before he became involved in the celebrated
	affair of the queen’s necklace. His friend the Cardinal de Rohan,
	enamoured of the charms of Marie Antoinette, was in sore distress at her
	coldness, and the displeasure she had so often manifested against him.
	There was at that time a lady named La Motte in the service of the queen,
	of whom the cardinal was foolish enough to make a confidant. Madame de la
	Motte, in return, endeavoured to make a tool of the cardinal, and
	succeeded but too well in her projects. In her capacity of chamber-woman,
	or lady of honour to the queen, she was present at an interview between
	her majesty and M. Boehmer, a wealthy jeweller of Paris, when the latter
	offered for sale a magnificent diamond necklace, valued at 1,600,000
	francs, or about 64,000<abbr class="foreign" title="pounds">l.</abbr> sterling. The queen admired it greatly, but
	dismissed the jeweller, with the expression of her regret that she was too
	poor to purchase it. Madame de la Motte formed a plan to get this costly
	ornament into her own possession, and determined to make the Cardinal de
	Rohan the instrument by which to effect it. She therefore sought an
	interview with him, and pretending to sympathise in his grief for the
	queen’s displeasure, told him she knew a way by which he might be restored
	to favour. She then mentioned the necklace, and the sorrow of the queen
	that she could not afford to buy it. The cardinal, who was as wealthy as
	he was foolish, immediately offered to purchase the necklace, and make a
	present of it to the queen. Madame de la Motte told him by no means to do
	so, as he would thereby offend her majesty. His plan would be to induce
	the jeweller to give her majesty credit, and accept her promissory note
	for the amount at a certain date, to be hereafter agreed upon. The
	cardinal readily agreed to the proposal, and instructed the jeweller to
	draw up an agreement, and he would procure the queen’s signature. He
	placed this in the hands of Madame de la Motte, who returned it shortly
	afterwards, with the words, “Bon, bon—approuvé—Marie Antoinette,”
	written in the margin. She told him at the same time that the queen was
	highly pleased with his conduct in the matter, and would appoint a meeting
	with him in the gardens of Versailles, <a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217"></a>when she would present him with a
	flower, as a token of her regard. The cardinal shewed the forged document
	to the jeweller, obtained the necklace, and delivered it into the hands of
	Madame de la Motte. So far all was well. Her next object was to satisfy
	the cardinal, who awaited impatiently the promised interview with his
	royal mistress. There was at that time in Paris a young woman named
	D’Oliva, noted for her resemblance to the queen; and Madame de la Motte,
	on the promise of a handsome reward, found no difficulty in persuading her
	to personate Marie Antoinette, and meet the Cardinal de Rohan at the
	evening twilight in the gardens of Versailles. The meeting took place
	accordingly. The cardinal was deceived by the uncertain light, the great
	resemblance of the counterfeit, and his own hopes; and having received the
	flower from Mademoiselle D’Oliva, went home with a lighter heart than had
	beat in his bosom for many a day.<a href="#fn50" id="fnm50" title="The enemies of..." class="fnmarker">50</a></p>

	<p>In the course of time the forgery of the queen’s signature was discovered.
	Boehmer the jeweller immediately named the Cardinal de Rohan and Madame de
	la Motte as the persons with whom he had negotiated, and they were both
	arrested and thrown into the Bastille. La Motte was subjected to a
	rigorous examination, and the disclosures she made implicating Cagliostro,
	he was seized, along with his wife, and also sent to the Bastille. A story
	involving so much scandal necessarily excited great curiosity. Nothing was
	to be heard of in Paris but the queen’s necklace, with surmises of the
	guilt or innocence of the several parties implicated. The husband of
	Madame de la Motte escaped to England, and in the opinion of many took the
	necklace with him, and there disposed of it to different jewellers in
	small quantities at a time. But Madame de la Motte insisted that she had
	entrusted it to Cagliostro, who had seized and taken it to pieces, to
	“swell the treasures of his immense unequalled fortune.” She spoke of him
	as “an empiric, a mean alchymist, a dreamer on the philosopher’s stone, a
	false prophet, a profaner of the true worship, the self-dubbed Count
	Cagliostro!” She further said that he originally conceived the project of
	ruining the Cardinal de Rohan; that he persuaded her, by the exercise of
	some magic influence over her mind, to aid and abet the scheme; and that
	he was a robber, a swindler, and a sorcerer!</p>

	<p>After all the accused parties had remained for upwards of six months in
	the Bastille, the trial commenced. The depositions of the <a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218"></a>witnesses having
	been heard, Cagliostro, as the principal culprit, was first called upon
	for his defence. He was listened to with the most breathless attention. He
	put himself into a theatrical attitude, and thus began:—“I am
	oppressed!—I am accused!—I am calumniated! Have I deserved this fate? I
	descend into my conscience, and I there find the peace that men refuse me!
	I have travelled a great deal—I am known over all Europe, and a great
	part of Asia and Africa. I have every where shewn myself the friend of my
	fellow-creatures. My knowledge, my time, my fortune have ever been
	employed in the relief of distress. I have studied and practised medicine;
	but I have never degraded that most noble and most consoling of arts by
	mercenary speculations of any kind. Though always giving, and never
	receiving, I have preserved my independence. I have even carried my
	delicacy so far as to refuse the favours of kings. I have given
	gratuitously my remedies and my advice to the rich; the poor have received
	from me both remedies and money. I have never contracted any debts, and my
	manners are pure and uncorrupted.” After much more self-laudation of the
	same kind, he went on to complain of the great hardships he had endured in
	being separated for so many months from his innocent and loving wife, who,
	as he was given to understand, had been detained in the Bastille, and
	perhaps chained in an unwholesome dungeon. He denied unequivocally that he
	had the necklace, or that he had ever seen it; and to silence the rumours
	and accusations against him, which his own secrecy with regard to the
	events of his life had perhaps originated, he expressed himself ready to
	satisfy the curiosity of the public, and to give a plain and full account
	of his career. He then told a romantic and incredible tale, which imposed
	upon no one. He said he neither knew the place of his birth nor the name
	of his parents, but that he spent his infancy in Medina, in Arabia, and
	was brought up under the name of Acharat. He lived in the palace of the
	Great Muphti in that city, and always had three servants to wait upon him,
	besides his preceptor, named Althotas. This Althotas was very fond of him,
	and told him that his father and mother, who were Christians and nobles,
	died when he was three months old, and left him in the care of the Muphti.
	He could never, he said, ascertain their names, for whenever he asked
	Althotas the question, he was told that it would be dangerous for him to
	know. Some incautious expressions dropped by his preceptor gave him reason
	to think they were from Malta. At the age of twelve he began his travels,
	and learned the various languages of the East. He remained three years in
	Mecca, where the cherif, or governor, shewed him so much kindness, and
	spoke to him so tenderly and affectionately, that he sometimes thought
	that personage was his father. He <a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219"></a>quitted this good man with tears in his
	eyes, and never saw him afterwards; but he was convinced that he was, even
	at that moment, indebted to his care for all the advantages he enjoyed.
	Whenever he arrived in any city, either of Europe or Asia, he found an
	account opened for him at the principal bankers’ or merchants’. He could
	draw upon them to the amount of thousands and hundreds of thousands; and
	no questions were ever asked beyond his name. He had only to mention the
	word ‘Acharat,’ and all his wants were supplied. He firmly believed that
	the Cherif of Mecca was the friend to whom all was owing. This was the
	secret of his wealth, and he had no occasion to resort to swindling for a
	livelihood. It was not worth his while to steal a diamond necklace when he
	had wealth enough to purchase as many as he pleased, and more magnificent
	ones than had ever been worn by a queen of France. As to the other charges
	brought against him by Madame de la Motte, he had but a short answer to
	give. She had called him an empiric. He was not unfamiliar with the word.
	If it meant a man who, without being a physician, had some knowledge of
	medicine, and took no fees—who cured both rich and poor, and took no
	money from either, he confessed that he was such a man, that he was an
	empiric. She had also called him a mean alchymist. Whether he were an
	alchymist or not, the epithet <em>mean</em> could only be applied to those who
	begged and cringed, and he had never done either. As regarded his being a
	dreamer about the philosopher’s stone, whatever his opinions upon that
	subject might be, he had been silent, and had never troubled the public
	with his dreams. Then, as to his being a false prophet, he had not always
	been so; for he had prophesied to the Cardinal de Rohan, that Madame de la
	Motte would prove a dangerous woman, and the result had verified the
	prediction. He denied that he was a profaner of the true worship, or that
	he had ever striven to bring religion into contempt; on the contrary, he
	respected every man’s religion, and never meddled with it. He also denied
	that he was a Rosicrucian, or that he had ever pretended to be three
	hundred years of age, or to have had one man in his service for a hundred
	and fifty years. In conclusion, he said every statement that Madame de la
	Motte had made regarding him was false, and that she was <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentiris
	impudentissime</em>, which two words he begged her counsel to translate for
	her, as it was not polite to tell her so in French.</p>

	<p>Such was the substance of his extraordinary answer to the charges against
	him; an answer which convinced those who were before doubtful that he was
	one of the most impudent impostors that had ever run the career of
	deception. Counsel were then heard on behalf of the Cardinal de Rohan and
	Madame de la Motte. It appearing <a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"></a>clearly that the cardinal was himself the
	dupe of a vile conspiracy, and there being no evidence against Cagliostro,
	they were both acquitted. Madame de la Motte was found guilty, and
	sentenced to be publicly whipped, and branded with a hot iron on the back.</p>

	<p>Cagliostro and his wife were then discharged from custody. On applying to
	the officers of the Bastille for the papers and effects which had been
	seized at his lodgings, he found that many of them had been abstracted. He
	thereupon brought an action against them for the recovery of his Mss. and
	a small portion of the powder of transmutation. Before the affair could be
	decided, he received orders to quit Paris within four-and-twenty hours.
	Fearing that if he were once more enclosed in the dungeons of the Bastille
	he should never see daylight again, he took his departure immediately and
	proceeded to England. On his arrival in London he made the acquaintance of
	the notorious Lord George Gordon, who espoused his cause warmly, and
	inserted a letter in the public papers, animadverting upon the conduct of
	the Queen of France in the affair of the necklace, and asserting that she
	was really the guilty party. For this letter Lord George was exposed to a
	prosecution at the instance of the French ambassador, found guilty of
	libel, and sentenced to fine and a long imprisonment.</p>

	<p>Cagliostro and the countess afterwards travelled in Italy, where they were
	arrested by the Papal government in 1789, and condemned to death. The
	charges against him were, that he was a freemason, a heretic, and a
	sorcerer. This unjustifiable sentence was afterwards commuted into one of
	perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of St. Angelo. His wife was allowed
	to escape severer punishment by immuring herself in a nunnery. Cagliostro
	did not long survive. The loss of liberty preyed upon his
	mind—accumulated misfortunes had injured his health and broken his
	spirit, and he died early in 1790. His fate may have been no better than
	he deserved, but it is impossible not to feel that his sentence for the
	crimes assigned was utterly disgraceful to the government that pronounced
	it.</p>

	<h3 class="alchymist">Present State of Alchymy.</h3>

	<p>We have now finished the list of the persons who have most distinguished
	themselves in this unprofitable pursuit. Among them are men of all ranks,
	characters, and conditions: the truth-seeking but erring philosopher; the
	ambitious prince and the needy noble, who have believed in it; as well as
	the designing charlatan, who has not believed in it, but has merely made
	the pretension to it the means of cheating his fellows, and living upon
	their credulity. One <a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"></a>or more of all these classes will be found in the
	foregoing pages. It will be seen, from the record of their lives, that the
	delusion was not altogether without its uses. Men, in striving to gain too
	much, do not always overreach themselves; if they cannot arrive at the
	inaccessible mountain-top, they may perhaps get half way towards it, and
	pick up some scraps of wisdom and knowledge on the road. The useful
	science of chemistry is not a little indebted to its spurious brother of
	alchymy. Many valuable discoveries have been made in that search for the
	impossible, which might otherwise have been hidden for centuries yet to
	come. Roger Bacon, in searching for the philosopher’s stone, discovered
	gunpowder, a still more extraordinary substance. Van Helmont, in the same
	pursuit, discovered the properties of gas; Geber made discoveries in
	chemistry which were equally important; and Paracelsus, amidst his
	perpetual visions of the transmutation of metals, found that mercury was a
	remedy for one of the most odious and excruciating of all the diseases
	that afflict humanity.</p>

	<p>In our day little mention is made in Europe of any new devotees of the
	science, though it is affirmed that one or two of our most illustrious men
	of science do not admit the pursuit to be so absurd and vain as it has
	been commonly considered in recent times. The belief in witchcraft, which
	is scarcely more absurd, still lingers in the popular mind; but few are so
	credulous as to believe that any elixir could make man live for centuries,
	or turn all our iron and pewter into gold. Alchymy, in Europe, may be said
	to be almost wholly exploded; but in the East it still flourishes in as
	great repute as ever. Recent travellers make constant mention of it,
	especially in China, Hindostan, Persia, Tartary, Egypt, and Arabia.</p>

	<h2 class="title">MODERN PROPHECIES.</h2>
	<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a href="images/image45.png"><img src="images/th_image45.png" alt="An ornately decorated letter A" id="image45" width="151" height="340" class="drop_cap" /></a><span class="first_word">An</span> epidemic terror of the end of the world has several times spread over
	the nations. The most remarkable was that which seized Christendom about
	the middle of the tenth century. Numbers of fanatics appeared in France,
	Germany, and Italy at that time, preaching that the thousand years
	prophesied in the Apocalypse as the term of the world’s duration were
	about to expire, and that the Son of Man would appear in the clouds to
	judge the godly and the ungodly. The delusion appears to have been
	discouraged by the Church, but it nevertheless spread rapidly among the
	people.<a href="#fn51" id="fnm51" title="See Gibbon and Voltaire..." class="fnmarker">51</a></p>
	
	<p>The scene of the last judgment was expected to be at Jerusalem. In the
	year 999, the number of pilgrims proceeding eastward, to await the coming
	of the Lord in that city, was so great that they were compared to a
	desolating army. Most of them sold their goods and possessions before they
	quitted Europe, and lived upon the proceeds in the Holy Land. Buildings of
	every sort were suffered to fall into ruins. It was thought useless to
	repair them, when the end of the world was so near. Many noble edifices
	were deliberately pulled down. Even churches, usually so well maintained,
	shared the general neglect. Knights, citizens, and serfs, travelled
	eastwards in company, taking with them their wives and children, singing
	psalms as they went, and looking with fearful eyes upon the sky, which
	they expected each minute to open, to let the Son of God descend in his
	glory.</p>

	<p>During the thousandth year the number of pilgrims increased. Most of them
	were smitten with terror as with a plague. Every phenomenon of nature
	filled them with alarm. A thunder-storm sent them all upon their knees in
	mid-march. It was the opinion that <a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"></a>thunder was the voice of God,
	announcing the day of judgment. Numbers expected the earth to open, and
	give up its dead at the sound. Every meteor in the sky seen at Jerusalem
	brought the whole Christian population into the streets to weep and pray.
	The pilgrims on the road were in the same alarm:</p>
	
	<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
		<p>“Lorsque, pendant la nuit, un globe de lumière</p>
		<p class="i2">S’échappa quelquefois de la voûte de cieux,</p>
		<p class="i2">Et traça dans sa chûte un long sillon de feux,</p>
		<p>La troupe suspendit sa marche solitaire.”<a href="#fn52" id="fnm52" title="Charlemagne..." class="fnmarker">52</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>Fanatic preachers kept up the flame of terror. Every shooting star
	furnished occasion for a sermon, in which the sublimity of the approaching
	judgment was the principal topic.</p>

	<p>The appearance of comets has been often thought to foretell the speedy
	dissolution of this world. Part of this belief still exists; but the comet
	is no longer looked upon as the sign, but the agent of destruction. So
	lately as in the year 1832 the greatest alarm spread over the continent of
	Europe, especially in Germany, lest the comet, whose appearance was then
	foretold by astronomers, should destroy the earth. The danger of our globe
	was gravely discussed. Many persons refrained from undertaking or
	concluding any business during that year, in consequence solely of their
	apprehension that this terrible comet would dash us and our world to
	atoms.</p>

	<p>During seasons of great pestilence, men have often believed the prophecies
	of crazed fanatics, that the end of the world was come. Credulity is
	always greatest in times of calamity. During the great plague, which
	ravaged all Europe between the years 1345 and 1350, it was generally
	considered that the end of the world was at hand. Pretended prophets were
	to be found in all the principal cities of Germany, France, and Italy,
	predicting that within ten years the trump of the archangel would sound,
	and the Saviour appear in the clouds to call the earth to judgment.</p>

	<p>No little consternation was created in London in 1736 by the prophecy of
	the famous Whiston, that the world would be destroyed in that year, on the
	13th of October. Crowds of people went out on the appointed day to
	Islington, Hampstead, and the fields intervening, to see the destruction
	of London, which was to be the “beginning of the end.” A satirical account
	of this folly is given in Swift’s <cite>Miscellanies</cite>, vol. iii., entitled <cite>A
	true and faithful Narrative of what passed in London on a Rumour of the
	Day of Judgment</cite>. An authentic narrative of this delusion would be
	interesting; but this solemn witticism of Pope and Gay is not to be
	depended upon.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"></a>In the year 1761 the citizens of London were alarmed by two shocks of an
	earthquake, and the prophecy of a third, which was to destroy them
	altogether. The first shock was felt on the 8th of February, and threw
	down several chimneys in the neighbourhood of Limehouse and Poplar; the
	second happened on the 8th of March, and was chiefly felt in the north of
	London, and towards Hampstead and Highgate. It soon became the subject of
	general remark, that there was exactly an interval of a month between the
	shocks; and a crack-brained fellow, named Bell, a soldier in the Life
	Guards, was so impressed with the idea that there would be a third in
	another month, that he lost his senses altogether, and ran about the
	streets predicting the destruction of London on the 5th of April. Most
	people thought that the <em>first</em> would have been a more appropriate day;
	but there were not wanting thousands who confidently believed the
	prediction, and took measures to transport themselves and families from
	the scene of the impending calamity. As the awful day approached, the
	excitement became intense, and great numbers of credulous people resorted
	to all the villages within a circuit of twenty miles, awaiting the doom of
	London. Islington, Highgate, Hampstead, Harrow, and Blackheath, were
	crowded with panic-stricken fugitives, who paid exorbitant prices for
	accommodation to the housekeepers of these secure retreats. Such as could
	not afford to pay for lodgings at any of those places, remained in London
	until two or three days before the time, and then encamped in the
	surrounding fields, awaiting the tremendous shock which was to lay their
	high city all level with the dust. As happened during a similar panic in
	the time of Henry VIII., the fear became contagious, and hundreds who had
	laughed at the prediction a week before, packed up their goods, when they
	saw others doing so, and hastened away. The river was thought to be a
	place of great security, and all the merchant-vessels in the port were
	filled with people, who passed the night between the 4th and 5th on board,
	expecting every instant to see St. Paul’s totter, and the towers of
	Westminster Abbey rock in the wind and fall amid a cloud of dust. The
	greater part of the fugitives returned on the following day, convinced
	that the prophet was a false one; but many judged it more prudent to allow
	a week to elapse before they trusted their dear limbs in London. Bell lost
	all credit in a short time, and was looked upon even by the most credulous
	as a mere madman. He tried some other prophecies, but nobody was deceived
	by them; and, in a few months afterwards, he was confined in a lunatic
	asylum.</p>

	<p>A panic terror of the end of the world seized the good people of Leeds and
	its neighbourhood in the year 1806. It arose from the <a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"></a>following
	circumstances. A hen, in a village close by, laid eggs, on which were
	inscribed the words, “<em>Christ is coming</em>.” Great numbers visited the spot,
	and examined these wondrous eggs, convinced that the day of judgment was
	near at hand. Like sailors in a storm, expecting every instant to go to
	the bottom, the believers suddenly became religious, prayed violently, and
	flattered themselves that they repented them of their evil courses. But a
	plain tale soon put them down, and quenched their religion entirely. Some
	gentlemen, hearing of the matter, went one fine morning, and caught the
	poor hen in the act of laying one of her miraculous eggs. They soon
	ascertained beyond doubt that the egg had been inscribed with some
	corrosive ink, and cruelly forced up again into the bird’s body. At this
	explanation, those who had prayed, now laughed, and the world wagged as
	merrily as of yore.</p>

	<p>At the time of the plague in Milan, in 1630, of which so affecting a
	description has been left us by Ripamonte, in his interesting work, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">De
	Peste Mediolani</cite>, the people, in their distress, listened with avidity to
	the predictions of astrologers and other impostors. It is singular enough
	that the plague was foretold a year before it broke out. A large comet
	appearing in 1628, the opinions of astrologers were divided with regard to
	it. Some insisted that it was a forerunner of a bloody war; others
	maintained that it predicted a great famine; but the greater number,
	founding their judgment upon its pale colour, thought it portended a
	pestilence. The fulfilment of their prediction brought them into great
	repute while the plague was raging.</p>

	<p>Other prophecies were current, which were asserted to have been delivered
	hundreds of years previously. They had a most pernicious effect upon the
	mind of the vulgar, as they induced a belief in fatalism. By taking away
	the hope of recovery—that greatest balm in every malady—they increased
	threefold the ravages of the disease. One singular prediction almost drove
	the unhappy people mad. An ancient couplet, preserved for ages by
	tradition, foretold, that in the year 1630 the devil would poison all
	Milan. Early one morning in April, and before the pestilence had reached
	its height, the passengers were surprised to see that all the doors in the
	principal streets of the city were marked with a curious daub, or spot, as
	if a sponge, filled with the purulent matter of the plague-sores, had been
	pressed against them. The whole population were speedily in movement to
	remark the strange appearance, and the greatest alarm spread rapidly.
	Every means was taken to discover the perpetrators, but in vain. At last
	the ancient prophecy was remembered, and prayers were offered up in all
	the churches, that the machinations of the Evil One might be defeated.
	Many persons were of opinion that the emissaries of foreign <a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"></a>powers were
	employed to spread infectious poison over the city; but by far the greater
	number were convinced that the powers of hell had conspired against them,
	and that the infection was spread by supernatural agencies. In the mean
	time the plague increased fearfully. Distrust and alarm took possession of
	every mind.  Every thing was believed to have been poisoned by the Devil;
	the waters of the wells, the standing corn in the fields, and the fruit
	upon the trees. It was believed that all objects of touch were poisoned;
	the walls of the houses, the pavements of the streets, and the very
	handles of the doors. The populace were raised to a pitch of ungovernable
	fury. A strict watch was kept for the Devil’s emissaries, and any man who
	wanted to be rid of an enemy, had only to say that he had seen him
	besmearing a door with ointment; his fate was certain death at the hands
	of the mob. An old man, upwards of eighty years of age, a daily frequenter
	of the church of St. Antonio, was seen, on rising from his knees, to wipe
	with the skirt of his cloak the stool on which he was about to sit down. A
	cry was raised immediately that he was besmearing the seat with poison. A
	mob of women, by whom the church was crowded, seized hold of the feeble
	old man, and dragged him out by the hair of his head, with horrid oaths
	and imprecations. He was trailed in this manner through the mire to the
	house of the municipal judge, that he might be put to the rack, and forced
	to discover his accomplices; but he expired on the way. Many other victims
	were sacrificed to the popular fury. One Mora, who appears to have been
	half a chemist and half a barber, was accused of being in league with the
	Devil to poison Milan. His house was surrounded, and a number of chemical
	preparations were found. The poor man asserted, that they were intended as
	preservatives against infection; but some physicians, to whom they were
	submitted, declared they were poison, Mora was put to the rack, where he
	for a long time asserted his innocence. He confessed at last, when his
	courage was worn down by torture, that he was in league with the Devil and
	foreign powers to poison the whole city; that he had anointed the doors,
	and infected the fountains of water. He named several persons as his
	accomplices, who were apprehended and put to a similar torture. They were
	all found guilty, and executed. Mora’s house was rased to the ground, and
	a column erected on the spot, with an inscription to commemorate his
	guilt.</p>

	<p>While the public mind was filled with these marvellous occurrences, the
	plague continued to increase. The crowds that were brought together to
	witness the executions spread the infection among one another. But the
	fury of their passions, and the extent of their credulity, kept pace with
	the violence of the plague; every <a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"></a>wonderful and preposterous story was
	believed. One, in particular, occupied them to the exclusion, for a long
	time, of every other. The Devil himself had been seen. He had taken a
	house in Milan, in which he prepared his poisonous unguents, and furnished
	them to his emissaries for distribution. One man had brooded over such
	tales till he became firmly convinced that the wild nights of his own
	fancy were realities. He stationed himself in the market-place of Milan,
	and related the following story to the crowds that gathered round him. He
	was standing, he said, at the door of the cathedral, late in the evening;
	and when there was nobody nigh, he saw a dark-coloured chariot, drawn by
	six milk-white horses, stop close beside him. The chariot was followed by
	a numerous train of domestics in dark liveries, mounted on dark-coloured
	steeds. In the chariot there sat a tall stranger of a majestic aspect; his
	long black hair floated in the wind—fire flashed from his large black
	eyes, and a curl of ineffable scorn dwelt upon his lips. The look of the
	stranger was so sublime that he was awed, and trembled with fear when he
	gazed upon him. His complexion was much darker than that of any man he had
	ever seen, and the atmosphere around him was hot and suffocating. He
	perceived immediately that he was a being of another world. The stranger,
	seeing his trepidation, asked him blandly, yet majestically, to mount
	beside him. He had no power to refuse, and before he was well aware that
	he had moved, he found himself in the chariot. Onwards they went, with the
	rapidity of the wind, the stranger speaking no word, until they stopped
	before a door in the high-street of Milan. There was a crowd of people in
	the street, but, to his great surprise, no one seemed to notice the
	extraordinary equipage and its numerous train. From this he concluded that
	they were invisible. The house at which they stopped appeared to be a
	shop, but the interior was like a vast half-ruined palace. He went with
	his mysterious guide through several large and dimly-lighted rooms. In one
	of them, surrounded by huge pillars of marble, a senate of ghosts was
	assembled, debating on the progress of the plague. Other parts of the
	building were enveloped in the thickest darkness, illumined at intervals
	by flashes of lightning, which allowed him to distinguish a number of
	gibing and chattering skeletons, running about and pursuing each other, or
	playing at leap-frog over one another’s backs. At the rear of the mansion
	was a wild, uncultivated plot of ground, in the midst of which arose a
	black rock. Down its sides rushed with fearful noise a torrent of
	poisonous water, which, insinuating itself through the soil, penetrated to
	all the springs of the city, and rendered them unfit for use. After he had
	been shewn all this, the stranger led him into another large chamber,
	filled with gold and <a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"></a>precious stones, all of which he offered him if he
	would kneel down and worship him, and consent to smear the doors and
	houses of Milan with a pestiferous salve which he held out to him. He now
	knew him to be the Devil, and in that moment of temptation, prayed to God
	to give him strength to resist. His prayer was heard—he refused the
	bribe. The stranger scowled horribly upon him—a loud clap of thunder
	burst over his head—the vivid lightning flashed in his eyes, and the next
	moment he found himself standing alone at the porch of the cathedral. He
	repeated this strange tale day after day, without any variation, and all
	the populace were firm believers in its truth. Repeated search was made to
	discover the mysterious house, but all in vain. The man pointed out
	several as resembling it, which were searched by the police; but the Demon
	of the Pestilence was not to be found, nor the hall of ghosts, nor the
	poisonous fountain. But the minds of the people were so impressed with the
	idea, that scores of witnesses, half crazed by disease, came forward to
	swear that they also had seen the diabolical stranger, and had heard his
	chariot, drawn by the milk-white steeds, rumbling over the streets at
	midnight with a sound louder than thunder.</p>

	<p>The number of persons who confessed that they were employed by the Devil
	to distribute poison is almost incredible. An epidemic frenzy was abroad,
	which seemed to be as contagious as the plague. Imagination was as
	disordered as the body, and day after day persons came voluntarily forward
	to accuse themselves. They generally had the marks of disease upon them,
	and some died in the act of confession.</p>

	<p>During the great plague of London, in 1665, the people listened with
	similar avidity to the predictions of quacks and fanatics. Defoe says,
	that at that time the people were more addicted to prophecies and
	astronomical conjurations, dreams, and old wives’ tales than ever they
	were before or since. Almanacs, and their predictions, frightened them
	terribly. Even the year before the plague broke out, they were greatly
	alarmed by the comet which then appeared, and anticipated that famine,
	pestilence, or fire would follow. Enthusiasts, while yet the disease had
	made but little progress, ran about the streets, predicting that in a few
	days London would be destroyed.</p>

	<p>A still more singular instance of the faith in predictions occurred in
	London in the year 1524. The city swarmed at that time with
	fortune-tellers and astrologers, who were consulted daily by people of
	every class in society on the secrets of futurity. As early as the month
	of June 1523, several of them concurred in predicting that, on the 1st day
	of February 1524, the waters of the Thames would swell to such a height as
	to overflow the whole city of London, and wash away ten thousand houses.
	The prophecy met implicit belief. It was <a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"></a>reiterated with the utmost
	confidence month after month, until so much alarm was excited that many
	families packed up their goods, and removed into Kent and Essex. As the
	time drew nigh, the number of these emigrants increased. In January,
	droves of workmen might be seen, followed by their wives and children,
	trudging on foot to the villages within fifteen or twenty miles, to await
	the catastrophe. People of a higher class were also to be seen in wagons
	and other vehicles bound on a similar errand. By the middle of January, at
	least twenty thousand persons had quitted the doomed city, leaving nothing
	but the bare walls of their homes to be swept away by the impending
	floods. Many of the richer sort took up their abode on the heights of
	Highgate, Hampstead, and Blackheath; and some erected tents as far away as
	Waltham Abbey on the north, and Croydon on the south of the Thames.
	Bolton, the prior of St. Bartholomew’s, was so alarmed, that he erected,
	at a very great expense, a sort of fortress at Harrow-on-the-Hill, which
	he stocked with provisions for two months. On the 24th of January, a week
	before the awful day which was to see the destruction of London, he
	removed thither, with the brethren and officers of the priory and all his
	household. A number of boats were conveyed in wagons to his fortress,
	furnished abundantly with expert rowers, in case the flood, reaching so
	high as Harrow, should force them to go farther for a resting-place. Many
	wealthy citizens prayed to share his retreat; but the prior, with a
	prudent forethought, admitted only his personal friends, and those who
	brought stores of eatables for the blockade.</p>

	<p>At last the morn, big with the fate of London, appeared in the east. The
	wondering crowds were astir at an early hour to watch the rising of the
	waters. The inundation, it was predicted, would be gradual, not sudden; so
	that they expected to have plenty of time to escape as soon as they saw
	the bosom of old Thames heave beyond the usual mark. But the majority were
	too much alarmed to trust to this, and thought themselves safer ten or
	twenty miles off. The Thames, unmindful of the foolish crowds upon its
	banks, flowed on quietly as of yore. The tide ebbed at its usual hour,
	flowed to its usual height, and then ebbed again, just as if twenty
	astrologers had not pledged their words to the contrary. Blank were their
	faces as evening approached, and as blank grew the faces of the citizens
	to think that they had made such fools of themselves. At last night set
	in, and the obstinate river would not lift its waters to sweep away even
	one house out of the ten thousand. Still, however, the people were afraid
	to go to sleep. Many hundreds remained up till dawn of the next day, lest
	the deluge should come upon them like a thief in the night.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"></a>On the morrow, it was seriously discussed whether it would not be
	advisable to duck the false prophets in the river. Luckily for them, they
	thought of an expedient which allayed the popular fury. They asserted
	that, by an error (a very slight one,) of a little figure, they had fixed
	the date of this awful inundation a whole century too early. The stars
	were right after all, and they, erring mortals, were wrong. The present
	generation of cockneys was safe, and London would be washed away, not in
	1524, but in 1624. At this announcement, Bolton the prior dismantled his
	fortress, and the weary emigrants came back.</p>

	<p>An eye-witness of the great fire of London, in an account preserved among
	the Harleian Mss. in the British Museum, and published in the transactions
	of the Royal Society of Antiquaries, relates another instance of the
	credulity of the Londoners. The writer, who accompanied the Duke of York
	day by day through the district included between the Fleet-bridge and the
	Thames, states that, in their efforts to check the progress of the flames,
	they were much impeded by the superstition of the people. Mother Shipton,
	in one of her prophecies, had said that London would be reduced to ashes,
	and they refused to make any efforts to prevent it.<a href="#fn53" id="fnm53" title="This prophecy..." class="fnmarker">53</a> A son of the
	noted Sir Kenelm Digby, who was also a pretender to the gifts of prophecy,
	persuaded them that no power on earth could prevent the fulfilment of the
	prediction; for it was written in the great book of fate that London was
	to be destroyed. Hundreds of persons, who might have rendered valuable
	assistance, and saved whole parishes from devastation, folded their arms
	and looked on. As many more gave themselves up, with the less compunction,
	to plunder a city which they could not save.<a href="#fn54" id="fnm54" title="The London Saturday Journal..." class="fnmarker">54</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"></a>The prophecies of Mother Shipton are still believed in many of the rural
	districts of England. In cottages and servants’ halls her reputation is
	great; and she rules, the most popular of British prophets, among all the
	uneducated, or half-educated, portions of the community. She is generally
	supposed to have been born at Knaresborough, in the reign of Henry VII.,
	and to have sold her soul to the Devil for the power of foretelling future
	events. Though during her lifetime she was looked upon as a witch, she yet
	escaped the witch’s fate, and died peaceably in her bed at an extreme old
	age, near Clifton in Yorkshire. A stone is said to have been erected to
	her memory in the churchyard of that place, with the following epitaph:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Here lies she who never lied,</p>
		<p>Whose skill often has been tried:</p>
		<p>Her prophecies shall still survive,</p>
		<p>And ever keep her name alive.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>“Never a day passed,” says her traditionary biography, “wherein, she did
	not relate something remarkable, and that required the most serious
	consideration. People flocked to her from far and near, her fame was so
	great. They went to her of all sorts, both old and young, rich and poor,
	especially young maidens, to be resolved of their doubts relating to
	things to come; and all returned wonderfully satisfied in the explanations
	she gave to their questions.” Among the rest, went the Abbot of Beverley,
	to whom she foretold the suppression of the monasteries by Henry VIII.,
	his marriage with Anne Boleyn, the fires for heretics in Smithfield, and
	the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. She also foretold the accession of
	James I., adding that, with him,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“From the cold North</p>
		<p>Every evil should come forth.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"></a>On a subsequent visit she uttered another prophecy, which, in the opinion
	of her believers, still remains unfulfilled, but may be expected to be
	realised during the present century:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“The time shall come when seas of blood</p>
		<p>Shall mingle with a greater flood.</p>
		<p>Great noise there shall be heard—great shouts and cries,</p>
		<p>And seas shall thunder louder than the skies;</p>
		<p>Then shall three lions fight with three and bring</p>
		<p>Joy to a people, honour to a king.</p>
		<p>That fiery year as soon as o’er,</p>
		<p>Peace shall then be as before;</p>
		<p>Plenty shall every where be found,</p>
		<p>And men with swords shall plough the ground.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">But the most famous of all her prophecies is one relating to London.
	Thousands of persons still shudder to think of the woes that are to burst
	over this unhappy realm, when London and Highgate are joined by one
	continuous line of houses. This junction, which, if the rage for building
	lasts much longer, in the same proportion as heretofore, bids fair to be
	soon accomplished, was predicted by her shortly before her death.
	Revolutions—the fall of mighty monarchs, and the shedding of much blood
	are to signalise that event. The very angels, afflicted by our woes, are
	to turn aside their heads, and weep for hapless Britain.</p>

	<p>But great as is the fame of Mother Shipton, she ranks but second in the
	list of British prophets. Merlin, the mighty Merlin, stands alone in his
	high pre-eminence—the first and greatest. As old Drayton sings, in his
	<cite>Poly-olbion</cite>:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Of Merlin and his skill what region doth not hear?</p>
		<p>The world shall still be full of Merlin every year.</p>
		<p>A thousand lingering years his prophecies have run,</p>
		<p>And scarcely shall have end till time itself be done.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Spenser, in his divine poem, has given us a powerful description of this
	renowned seer—</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p class="i12">      “who had in magic more insight</p>
			<p>Than ever him before, or after, living wight.</p>

			<p class="i2">That to this day, for terror of his name,</p>
			<p>The fiends do quake, when any him to them does name.</p>

		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page233" title="233"></a>And soothe men say that he was not the sonne</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">In these verses the poet has preserved the popular belief with regard to
	Merlin, who is generally supposed to have been a contemporary of
	Vortigern. Opinion is divided as to whether he were a real personage, or a
	mere impersonation, formed by the poetic fancy of a credulous people. It
	seems most probable that such a man did exist, and that, possessing
	knowledge as much above the comprehension of his age, as that possessed by
	Friar Bacon was beyond the reach of his, he was endowed by the wondering
	crowd with the supernatural attributes that Spenser has enumerated.</p>

	<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth translated Merlin’s poetical odes, or prophecies,
	into Latin prose; and he was much reverenced not only by Geoffrey, but by
	most of the old annalists. In a <cite>Life of Merlin, with his Prophecies and
	Predictions interpreted and made good by our English Annals</cite>, by Thomas
	Heywood, published in the reign of Charles I., we find several of these
	pretended prophecies. They seem, however, to have been all written by
	Heywood himself. They are in terms too plain and positive to allow any one
	to doubt for a moment of their having been composed <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex post facto</em>.
	Speaking of Richard I., he says:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“The Lion’s heart will ’gainst the Saracen rise,</p>
		<p>And purchase from him many a glorious prize;</p>
		<p>The rose and lily shall at first unite,</p>
		<p>But, parting of the prey prove opposite.   *   *   *</p>
		<p>But while abroad these great acts shall be done,</p>
		<p>All things at home shall to disorder run.</p>
		<p>Cooped up and caged then shall the Lion be,</p>
		<p>But, after sufferance, ransomed and set free.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">The simple-minded Thomas Heywood gravely goes on to inform us, that all
	these things actually came to pass. Upon Richard III. he is equally
	luminous. He says:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“A hunch-backed monster, who with teeth is born,</p>
		<p>The mockery of art and nature’s scorn;</p>
		<p>Who from the womb preposterously is hurled,</p>
		<p>And with feet forward thrust into the world,</p>
		<p>Shall, from the lower earth on which he stood,</p>
		<p>Wade, every step he mounts, knee-deep in blood.</p>
		<p>He shall to th’ height of all his hopes aspire,</p>
		<p>And, clothed in state, his ugly shape admire;</p>
		<p>But, when he thinks himself most safe to stand,</p>
		<p>From foreign parts a native whelp shall land.”</p>
	</div>


	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"></a>Another of these prophecies after the event tells us that Henry
	VIII. should take the power from Rome, “and bring it home unto
	his British bower;” that he should “root out from the land all the
	razored skulls;” and that he should neither spare “man in his rage
	nor woman in his lust;” and that, in the time of his next successor
	but one, “there should come in the fagot and the stake.” Master
	Heywood closes Merlin’s prophecies at his own day, and does not give
	even a glimpse of what was to befall England after his decease. Many
	other prophecies, besides those quoted by him, were, he says, dispersed
	abroad, in his day, under the name of Merlin; but he gives
	his readers a taste of one only, and that is the following:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“When hempe is ripe and ready to pull,</p>
		<p>Then, Englishman, beware thy skull.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">This prophecy, which, one would think, ought to have put him in mind of
	the gallows, at that time the not unusual fate of false prophets, he
	explains thus: “In this word <span class="small_all_caps">HEMPE</span> be five letters. Now, by reckoning the
	five successive princes from Henry VIII., this prophecy is easily
	explained: H signifieth King Henry before-named; E, Edward, his son, the
	sixth of that name; M, Mary, who succeeded him; P, Philip of Spain, who,
	by marrying Queen Mary, participated with her in the English diadem; and,
	lastly, E signifieth Queen Elizabeth, after whose death there was a great
	feare that some troubles might have arisen about the crown.” As this did
	not happen, Heywood, who was a sly rogue in a small way, gets out of the
	scrape by saying, “Yet proved this augury true, though not according to
	the former expectation; for, after the peaceful inauguration of King
	James, there was great mortality, not in London only, but through the
	whole kingdom, and from which the nation was not quite clean in seven
	years after.”</p>

	<p>This is not unlike the subterfuge of Peter of Pontefract, who had
	prophesied the death and deposition of King John, and who was hanged by
	that monarch for his pains. A very graphic and amusing account of this
	pretended prophet is given by Grafton, in his <em>Chronicles of
	England</em>.<a href="#fn55" id="fnm55" title="Chronicles of England" class="fnmarker">55</a> “In the meanwhile,” says he, “the priestes within England
	had provided them a false and counterfeated prophet, called Peter
	Wakefielde, a Yorkshire man, who was an hermite, an idle gadder about, and
	a pratlyng marchant. Now, to bring this Peter in credite, and the kyng out
	of all credite with his people, diverse vaine persons bruted dayly among
	the commons of the realme, that Christe had twice appered unto him in the
	shape of a childe, betwene the prieste’s handes, once at Yorke, another
	tyme at Pomfret; <a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"></a>and that he had breathed upon him thrice, saying,
	‘<em>Peace, peace, peace</em>,’ and teachyng many things, which he anon declared
	to the bishops, and bid the people amend their naughtie living. Being rapt
	also in spirite, they sayde he behelde the joyes of heaven and sorrowes of
	hell; for scant were there three in the realme, sayde he, that lived
	christianly.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“This counterfeated soothsayer prophesied of King John, that he should
		reigne no longer than the Ascension-day next followyng, which was in the
		yere of our Lord 1211, and was the thirteenth yere from his coronation;
		and this, he said, he had by revelation. Then it was of him demanded,
		whether he should be slaine or be deposed, or should voluntarily give over
		the crowne? He aunswered, that he could not tell; but of this he was sure
		(he sayd), that neither he nor any of his stock or lineage should reigne
		after that day.</p>

		<p>“The king, hering of this, laughed much at it, and made but a scoff
		thereat. ‘Tush!’ saith he, ‘it is but an ideot knave, and such an one as
		lacketh his right wittes.’ But when this foolish prophet had so escaped
		the daunger of the kinge’s displeasure, and that he made no more of it, he
		gate him abroad, and prated thereof at large, as he was a very idle
		vagabond, and used to trattle and talke more than ynough; so that they
		which loved the king caused him anon after to be apprehended as a
		malefactor, and to be throwen in prison, the king not yet knowing thereof.</p>

		<p>“Anone after the fame of this phantasticall prophet went all the realme
		over, and his name was knowen every where, as foolishnesse is much
		regarded of the people, where wisdome is not in place; specially because
		he was then imprisoned for the matter, the rumour was the larger, their
		wonderynges were the wantoner, their practises the foolisher, their busye
		talkes and other idle doinges the greater. Continually from thence, as the
		rude manner of people is, old gossyps tales went abroad, new tales were
		invented, fables were added to fables, and lyes grew upon lyes. So that
		every daye newe slanders were laide upon the king, and not one of them
		true. Rumors arose, blasphemyes were sprede, the enemyes rejoyced, and
		treasons by the priestes were mainteyned; and what lykewise was surmised,
		or other subtiltye practised, all was then fathered upon this foolish
		prophet, as ‘thus saith Peter Wakefield;’ ‘thus hath he prophesied;’ ‘and
		thus it shall come to pass;’ yea, many times, when he thought nothing
		lesse. And when the Ascension-day was come, which was prophecyed of
		before, King John commanded his royal tent to be spread in the open
		fielde, passing that day with his noble counseyle and men of honour in the
		greatest solemnitie that ever he did before; solacing himself with
		musickale instrumentes and songs, most in sight among his <a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"></a>trustie
		friendes. When that day was paste in all prosperitie and myrth, his
		enemyes being confused, turned all into an allegorical understanding to
		make the prophecie good, and sayde, ‘He is no longer king, for the pope
		reigneth, and not he.’ [King John was labouring under a sentence of
		excommunication at the time.]</p>

		<p>“Then was the king by his council perswaded that this false prophet had
		troubled the realme, perverted the heartes of the people, and raysed the
		Commons against him; for his wordes went over the sea, by the help of his
		prelates, and came to the French king’s eare, and gave to him a great
		encouragement to invade the lande. He had not else done it so sodeinely.
		But he was most fowly deceived, as all they are and shall be that put
		their trust in such dark drowsye dreames of hipocrites. The king therefore
		commended that he should be hanged up, and his sonne also with him, lest
		any more false prophets should arise of that race.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Heywood, who was a great stickler for the truth of all sorts of
	prophecies, gives a much more favourable account of this Peter of Pomfret,
	or Pontefract, whose fate he would, in all probability, have shared, if he
	had had the misfortune to have flourished in the same age. He says, that
	Peter, who was not only a prophet, but a bard, predicted divers of King
	John’s disasters, which fell out accordingly. On being taxed for a lying
	prophet in having predicted that the king would be deposed before he
	entered into the fifteenth year of his reign, he answered him boldly, that
	all he had said was justifiable and true; for that, having given up his
	crown to the pope, and paying him an annual tribute, the pope reigned, and
	not he. Heywood thought this explanation to be perfectly satisfactory, and
	the prophet’s faith for ever established.</p>

	<p>But to return to Merlin. Of him even to this day it may be said, in the
	words which Burns has applied to another notorious personage,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Great was his power and great his fame;</p>
		<p>Far kenned and noted is his name.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">His reputation is by no means confined to the land of his birth, but
	extends through most of the nations of Europe. A very curious volume of
	his <cite>Life, Prophecies, and Miracles</cite>, written, it is supposed, by Robert
	de Bosron, was printed at Paris in 1498, which states, that the devil
	himself was his father, and that he spoke the instant he was born, and
	assured his mother, a very virtuous young woman, that she should not die
	in childbed with him, as her ill-natured neighbours had predicted. The
	judge of the district, hearing of so marvellous an occurrence, summoned
	both mother and child to appear before him; and they went accordingly the
	same day. To put the <a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"></a>wisdom of the young prophet most effectually to the
	test, the judge asked him if he knew his own father? To which the infant
	Merlin replied, in a clear, sonorous voice, “Yes, my father is the Devil;
	and I have his power, and know all things, past, present, and to come.”
	His worship clapped his hands in astonishment, and took the prudent
	resolution of not molesting so awful a child or its mother either.</p>

	<p>Early tradition attributes the building of Stonehenge to the power of
	Merlin. It was believed that those mighty stones were whirled through the
	air, at his command, from Ireland to Salisbury Plain; and that he arranged
	them in the form in which they now stand, to commemorate for ever the
	unhappy fate of three hundred British chiefs, who were massacred on that
	spot by the Saxons.</p>

	<p>At Abergwylly, near Carmarthen, is still shewn the cave of the prophet and
	the scene of his incantations. How beautiful is the description of it
	given by Spenser in his <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>! The lines need no apology for
	their repetition here, and any sketch of the great prophet of Britain
	would be incomplete without them:</p>

	<div class="poem">

	<p>Amongst other English prophets, a belief in whose power has not been
	entirely effaced by the light of advancing knowledge, is Robert Nixon, the
	Cheshire idiot, a contemporary of Mother Shipton. The popular accounts of
	this man say, that he was born of poor parents, not far from Vale Royal,
	on the edge of the forest of Delamere. He was brought up to the plough,
	but was so ignorant and stupid, that nothing could be made of him. Every
	body thought him irretrievably insane, and paid no attention to the
	strange, unconnected discourses which he held. Many of his prophecies are
	believed to have been lost in this manner. But they were not always
	destined to be wasted upon dull and inattentive ears. An incident occurred
	which brought him into notice, and established his fame as a prophet of
	the first calibre. He was ploughing in a field when he suddenly stopped
	from his labour, and with a wild look and strange gesture, exclaimed,
	“<em>Now, Dick! now, Harry! O, ill done, Dick! O, well done, Harry! Harry has
	gained the day!</em>” His fellow-labourers in the field did not know what to
	make of this rhapsody; but the next day cleared up the mystery. News was
	brought by a messenger, in hot haste, that at the very instant when Nixon
	had thus ejaculated, Richard III. had been slain at the battle of
	Bosworth, and Henry VII. proclaimed king of England.</p>

	<p>It was not long before the fame of the new prophet reached the ears of the
	king, who expressed a wish to see and converse with him. A messenger was
	accordingly despatched to bring him to court; but long before he reached
	Cheshire, Nixon knew and dreaded the honours that awaited him. Indeed it
	was said, that at the very instant the king expressed the wish, Nixon was,
	by supernatural means, made acquainted with it, and that he ran about the
	town of Over in great distress of mind, calling out, like a madman, that
	Henry had sent for him, and that he must go to court, and be <em>clammed</em>,
	that is, starved to death. These expressions excited no little wonder;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239"></a>but, on the third day, the messenger arrived, and carried him to court,
	leaving on the minds of the good people of Cheshire an impression that
	their prophet was one of the greatest ever born. On his arrival King Henry
	appeared to be troubled exceedingly at the loss of a valuable diamond, and
	asked Nixon if he could inform him where it was to be found. Henry had
	hidden the diamond himself, with a view to test the prophet’s skill.
	Great, therefore, was his surprise when Nixon answered him in the words of
	the old proverb, “Those who hide can find.” From that time forth the king
	implicitly believed that he had the gift of prophecy, and ordered all his
	words to be taken down.</p>

	<p>During all the time of his residence at court he was in constant fear of
	being starved to death, and repeatedly told the king that such would be
	his fate, if he were not allowed to depart, and return into his own
	country. Henry would not suffer it, but gave strict orders to all his
	officers and cooks to give him as much to eat as he wanted. He lived so
	well, that for some time he seemed to be thriving like a nobleman’s
	steward, and growing as fat as an alderman. One day the king went out
	hunting, when Nixon ran to the palace gate, and entreated on his knees
	that he might not be left behind to be starved. The king laughed, and
	calling an officer, told him to take especial care of the prophet during
	his absence, and rode away to the forest. After his departure, the
	servants of the palace began to jeer at and insult Nixon, whom they
	imagined to be much better treated than he deserved. Nixon complained to
	the officer, who, to prevent him from being further molested, locked him
	up in the king’s own closet, and brought him regularly his four meals a
	day. But it so happened that a messenger arrived from the king to this
	officer, requiring his immediate presence at Winchester, on a matter of
	life and death. So great was his haste to obey the king’s command, that he
	mounted on the horse behind the messenger, and rode off, without bestowing
	a thought upon poor Nixon. He did not return till three days afterwards,
	when, remembering the prophet for the first time, he went to the king’s
	closet, and found him lying upon the floor, starved to death, as he had
	predicted.</p>

	<p>Among the prophecies of his which are believed to have been fulfilled are
	the following, which relate to the times of the Pretender:</p>

	<div class="poem emphasize">
		<p>“A great man shall come into England,</p>
		<p>But the son of a king</p>
		<p>Shall take from him the victory.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="poem emphasize">
		<p>“Crows shall drink the blood of many nobles,</p>
		<p>And the North shall rise against the South.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="poem emphasize">
		<p>“<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"></a>The coek of the North shall be made to flee,</p>
		<p>And his feather be plucked for his pride,</p>
		<p>That he shall almost curse the day that he was born.”</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">All these, say his admirers, are as clear as the sun at noon-day. The
	first denotes the defeat of Prince Charles Edward, at the battle of
	Culloden, by the Duke of Cumberland; the second, the execution of Lords
	Derwentwater, Balmerino, and Lovat; and the third, the retreat of the
	Pretender from the shores of Britain. Among the prophecies that still
	remain to be accomplished are the following:</p>

	<div class="poem emphasize">
		<p>“Between seven, eight, and nine,</p>
		<p> In England wonders shall be seen;</p>
		<p> Between nine and thirteen</p>
		<p> All sorrow shall be done.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="poem emphasize">
		<p>“Through our own money and our men</p>
		<p> Shall a dreadful war begin.</p>
		<p> Between the sickle and the suck</p>
		<p> All England shall have a pluck.”</p>
	</div>

	<blockquote class="emphasize">
		<p>“Foreign nations shall invade England with snow on their helmets, and
			shall bring plague, famine, and murder in the skirts of their garments.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="emphasize">
		<p>“The town of Nantwich shall be swept away by a flood.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Of the two first of these no explanation has yet been attempted; but some
	event or other will doubtless be twisted into such a shape as will fit
	them. The third, relative to the invasion of England by a nation with snow
	on their helmets, is supposed by the old women to foretell most clearly a
	coming war with Russia. As to the last, there are not a few in the town
	mentioned who devoutly believe that such will be its fate. Happily for
	their peace of mind, the prophet said nothing of the year that was to
	witness the awful calamity; so that they think it as likely to be two
	centuries hence as now.</p>

	<p>The popular biographers of Nixon conclude their account of him by saying,
	that “his prophecies are by some persons thought fables; yet by what has
	come to pass, it is now thought, and very plainly appears, that most of
	them have proved, or will prove, true; for which we, on all occasions,
	ought not only to exert our utmost might to repel by force our enemies,
	but to refrain from our abandoned and wicked course of life, and to make
	our continual prayer to God for protection and safety.” To this, though a
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sequitur</em>, every one will cry, Amen!</p>

	<p>Besides the prophets, there have been the almanac-makers Lilly, Poor
	Robin, Partridge, and Francis Moore physician, in England and Matthew
	Laensbergh, in France and Belgium. But great as were their pretensions,
	they were modesty itself in comparison with <a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"></a>Merlin, Shipton, and Nixon,
	who fixed their minds upon higher things than the weather, and were not so
	restrained as to prophesy for only one year at a time. After such prophets
	the almanac-makers hardly deserve to be mentioned; not even the renowned
	Partridge, whose prognostications set all England agog in 1708, and whose
	death while still alive was so pleasantly and satisfactorily proved by
	Isaac Bickerstaff. The anti-climax would be too palpable, and they and
	their doings must be left uncommemorated.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> accordance with the plan laid down, we proceed to the consideration of
	the follies into which men have been led by their eager desire to pierce
	the thick darkness of futurity. God himself, for his own wise purposes,
	has more than once undrawn the impenetrable veil which shrouds those awful
	secrets; and, for purposes just as wise, he has decreed that, except in
	these instances, ignorance shall be our lot for ever. It is happy for man
	that he does not know what the morrow is to bring forth; but, unaware of
	this great blessing, he has, in all ages of the world, presumptuously
	endeavoured to trace the events of unborn centuries, and anticipate the
	march of time. He has reduced this presumption into a study. He has
	divided it into sciences and systems without number, employing his whole
	life in the vain pursuit. Upon no subject has it been so easy to deceive
	the world as upon this. In every breast the curiosity exists in a greater
	or less degree, and can only be conquered by a long course of
	self-examination, and a firm reliance that the future would not be hidden
	from our sight, if it were right that we should be acquainted with it.</p>

	<p>An undue opinion of our own importance in the scale of creation is at the
	bottom of all our unwarrantable notions in this respect. How flattering to
	the pride of man to think that the stars in their courses watch over him,
	and typify, by their movements and aspects, the joys or the sorrows that
	await him! He, less in proportion to the universe than the all-but
	invisible insects that feed in myriads on a summer’s leaf are to this
	great globe itself, fondly imagines that eternal worlds were chiefly
	created to prognosticate his fate. How we should pity the arrogance of the
	worm that crawls at our feet, if we knew that it also desired to know the
	secrets of futurity, and imagined that meteors shot athwart the sky to
	warn it that a tom-tit was hovering near to gobble it up; that storms and
	earthquakes, the <a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243"></a>revolutions of empires, or the fall of mighty monarchs,
	only happened to predict its birth, its progress, and its decay! Not a
	whit less presuming has man shewn himself; not a whit less arrogant are
	the sciences, so called, of astrology, augury, necromancy, geomancy,
	palmistry, and divination of every kind.</p>

	<p>Leaving out of view the oracles of pagan antiquity and religious
	predictions in general, and confining ourselves solely to the persons who,
	in modern times, have made themselves most conspicuous in foretelling the
	future, we shall find that the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were
	the golden age of these impostors. Many of them have been already
	mentioned in their character of alchymists. The union of the two
	pretensions is not at all surprising. It was to be expected that those who
	assumed a power so preposterous as that of prolonging the life of man for
	several centuries, should pretend, at the same time, to foretell the
	events which were to mark that preternatural span of existence. The world
	would as readily believe that they had discovered all secrets, as that
	they had only discovered one. The most celebrated astrologers of Europe,
	three centuries ago, were alchymists. Agrippa, Paracelsus, Dr. Dee, and
	the Rosicrucians, all laid as much stress upon their knowledge of the days
	to come, as upon their pretended possession of the philosopher’s stone and
	the elixir of life. In their time, ideas of the wonderful, the diabolical,
	and the supernatural, were rifer than ever they were before. The devil or
	the stars were universally believed to meddle constantly in the affairs of
	men; and both were to be consulted with proper ceremonies. Those who were
	of a melancholy and gloomy temperament betook themselves to necromancy and
	sorcery; those more cheerful and aspiring devoted themselves to astrology.
	The latter science was encouraged by all the monarchs and governments of
	that age. In England, from the time of Elizabeth to that of William and
	Mary, judicial astrology was in high repute. During that period flourished
	Drs. Dee, Lamb, and Forman; with Lilly, Booker, Gadbury, Evans, and scores
	of nameless impostors in every considerable town and village in the
	country, who made it their business to cast nativities, aid in the
	recovery of stolen goods, prognosticate happy or unhappy marriages,
	predict whether journeys would be prosperous, and note lucky moments for
	the commencement of any enterprise, from the setting up of a cobbler’s
	shop to the marching of an army. Men who, to use the words of Butler, did</p>

	</div>

	<p>In Lilly’s <cite>Memoirs of his Life and Times</cite>, there are many notices of the
	inferior quacks who then abounded, and upon whom he pretended to look down
	with supreme contempt; not because they were astrologers, but because they
	debased that noble art by taking fees for the recovery of stolen property.
	From Butler’s <cite>Hudibras</cite>, and its curious notes, we may learn what immense
	numbers of these fellows lived upon the credulity of mankind in that age
	of witchcraft and diablerie. Even in our day, how great is the reputation
	enjoyed by the almanac-makers, who assume the name of Francis Moore! But
	in the time of Charles I. and the Commonwealth the most learned, the most
	noble, and the most conspicuous characters did not hesitate to consult
	astrologers in the most open manner. Lilly, whom Butler has immortalised
	under the name of Sydrophel, relates, that he proposed to write a work
	called <cite>An Introduction to Astrology</cite>, in which he would satisfy the whole
	kingdom of the lawfulness of that art. Many of the soldiers were for it,
	he says, and many of the Independent party, and abundance of worthy men in
	the House of Commons, his assured friends, and able to take his part
	against the Presbyterians, who would have silenced his predictions if they
	could. He afterwards carried his plan into execution, and when his book
	was published, went with another astrologer named Booker to the
	headquarters of the parliamentary army at Windsor, where they were
	welcomed and feasted in the garden where General Fairfax lodged. They were
	afterwards introduced to the general, who received them very kindly, and
	made allusion to some of their predictions. He hoped their art was lawful
	and agreeable to God’s word; but he did not understand it himself. He did
	not doubt, however, that the two astrologers feared God, and therefore he
	had a good opinion of them. Lilly assured him that the art of astrology
	was quite consonant to the Scriptures; and confidently predicted from his
	knowledge of the stars, that the parliamentary army would overthrow all
	its enemies. In Oliver’s Protectorate, this quack informs us that he wrote
	freely enough. He became an Independent, and all the soldiery were his
	friends. When he went to Scotland, he saw a soldier standing in front of
	the army with a book of prophecies in his hand, exclaiming <a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245"></a>to the several
	companies as they passed by him, “Lo! hear what Lilly saith: you are in
	this month promised victory! Fight it out, brave boys! and then read that
	month’s prediction!”</p>

	<p>After the great fire of London, which Lilly said he had foretold, he was
	sent for by the committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire
	into the causes of the calamity. In his <cite>Monarchy or no Monarchy</cite>,
	published in 1651, he had inserted an hieroglyphical plate representing on
	one side persons in winding-sheets digging graves; and on the other a
	large city in flames. After the great fire, some sapient member of the
	legislature bethought him of Lilly’s book, and having mentioned it in the
	house, it was agreed that the astrologer should be summoned. Lilly
	attended accordingly, when Sir Robert Brook told him the reason of his
	summons, and called upon him to declare what he knew. This was a rare
	opportunity for the vainglorious Lilly to vaunt his abilities; and he
	began a long speech in praise of himself and his pretended science. He
	said that, after the execution of Charles I., he was extremely desirous to
	know what might from that time forth happen to the parliament and to the
	nation in general. He therefore consulted the stars, and satisfied
	himself. The result of his judgment he put into emblems and hieroglyphics,
	without any commentary, so that the true meaning might be concealed from
	the vulgar, and made manifest only to the wise; imitating in this the
	example of many wise philosophers who had done the like.</p>

	<p>“Did you foresee the year of the fire?” said a member. “No,” quoth Lilly,
	“nor was I desirous. Of that I made no scrutiny.” After some further
	parley, the house found they could make nothing of the astrologer, and
	dismissed him with great civility.</p>

	<p>One specimen of the explanation of a prophecy given by Lilly, and related
	by him with much complacency, will be sufficient to shew the sort of trash
	by which he imposed upon the million. “In the year 1588,” says he, “there
	was a prophecy printed in Greek characters, exactly deciphering the long
	troubles of the English nation from 1641 to 1660.” And it ended thus: “And
	after him shall come a dreadful dead man, and with him a royal G, of the
	best blood in the world; and he shall have the crown, and shall set
	England on the right way, and put out all heresies.” The following is the
	explanation of this oracular absurdity:</p>

	<blockquote class="emphasize">
		<p>“Monkery being extinguished above eighty or ninety years, and the Lord
		General’s name being Monk, is the dead man. The royal G or C [it is gamma
		in the Greek, intending C in the Latin, being the third letter in the
		alphabet] is Charles II., who for his extraction may be said to be of the
		best blood of the world.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246"></a>In France and Germany astrologers met even more encouragement than they
	received in England. In very early ages Charlemagne and his successors
	fulminated their wrath against them in common with sorcerers. Louis XI.,
	that most superstitious of men, entertained great numbers of them at his
	court; and Catherine de Medicis, that most superstitious of women, hardly
	ever undertook any affair of importance without consulting them. She
	chiefly favoured her own countrymen; and during the time she governed
	France, the land was overrun by Italian conjurors, necromancers, and
	fortune-tellers of every kind. But the chief astrologer of that day,
	beyond all doubt, was the celebrated Nostradamus, physician to her
	husband, King Henry II. He was born in 1503 at the town of St. Remi, in
	Provence, where his father was a notary. He did not acquire much fame till
	he was past his fiftieth year, when his famous <cite>Centuries</cite>, a collection
	of verses, written in obscure and almost unintelligible language, began to
	excite attention. They were so much spoken of in 1556, that Henry II.
	resolved to attach so skilful a man to his service, and appointed him his
	physician. In a biographical notice of him, prefixed to the edition of his
	<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vraies Centuries</cite>, published at Amsterdam in 1668, we are informed that
	he often discoursed with his royal master on the secrets of futurity, and
	received many great presents as his reward, besides his usual allowance
	for medical attendance. After the death of Henry he retired to his native
	place, where Charles IX. paid him a visit in 1564; and was so impressed
	with veneration for his wondrous knowledge of the things that were to be,
	not in France only, but in the whole world for hundreds of <a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247"></a>years to come,
	that he made him a counsellor of state and his own physician, besides
	treating him in other matters with a royal liberality. “In fine,”
	continues his biographer, “I should be too prolix were I to tell all the
	honours conferred upon him, and all the great nobles and learned men that
	arrived at his house from the very ends of the earth, to see and converse
	with him as if he had been an oracle. Many strangers, in fact, came to
	France for no other purpose than to consult him.”</p>

		<p class="caption">NOSTRADAMUS.—FROM THE FRONTISPIECE TO A COLLECTION OF HIS PROPHECIES, PUBLISHED AT AMSTERDAM, A.D. 1666.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The prophecies of Nostradamus consist of upwards of a thousand stanzas,
	each of four lines, and are to the full as obscure as the oracles of old.
	They take so great a latitude, both as to time and space, that they are
	almost sure to be fulfilled somewhere or other in the course of a few
	centuries. A little ingenuity, like that evinced by Lilly in his
	explanation about General Monk and the dreadful dead man, might easily
	make events to fit some of them.<a href="#fn58" id="fnm58" title="Let us try..." class="fnmarker">58</a></p>

	<p>He is to this day extremely popular in France and the Walloon country of
	Belgium, where old farmer-wives consult him with great confidence and
	assiduity.</p>

	<p>Catherine di Medicis was not the only member of her illustrious house who
	entertained astrologers. At the beginning of the fifteenth century there
	was a man, named Basil, residing in Florence, who was noted over all Italy
	for his skill in piercing the darkness of futurity. It is said that he
	foretold to Cosmo di Medicis, then a private citizen, that he would attain
	high dignity, inasmuch as the ascendant of his nativity was adorned with
	the same propitious aspects as those of Augustus Cæsar and the Emperor
	Charles V.<a href="#fn59" id="fnm59" title="Hermippus Redivivus" class="fnmarker">59</a> Another astrologer foretold the death of Prince Alexander
	di Medicis; and so very minute and particular was he in all the
	circumstances, that he was suspected of being chiefly instrumental in
	fulfilling his own prophecy—<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248"></a>a very common resource with these fellows to
	keep up their credit. He foretold confidently that the prince should die
	by the hand of his own familiar friend, a person of a slender habit of
	body, a small face, a swarthy complexion, and of most remarkable
	taciturnity. So it afterwards happened, Alexander having been murdered in
	his chamber by his cousin Lorenzo, who corresponded exactly with the above
	description.<a href="#fn60" id="fnm60" title="Jovii Elog..." class="fnmarker">60</a> The author of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermippus Redivivus</cite>, in relating this
	story, inclines to the belief that the astrologer was guiltless of any
	participation in the crime, but was employed by some friend of Prince
	Alexander to warn him of his danger.</p>

	<p>A much more remarkable story is told of an astrologer who lived in Romagna
	in the fifteenth century, and whose name was Antiochus Tibertus.<a href="#fn61" id="fnm61" title="Les Anecdotes de Florence..." class="fnmarker">61</a> At
	that time nearly all the petty sovereigns of Italy retained such men in
	their service; and Tibertus, having studied the mathematics with great
	success at Paris, and delivered many predictions, some of which, for
	guesses, were not deficient in shrewdness, was taken into the household of
	Pandolfo di Malatesta, the sovereign of Rimini. His reputation was so
	great, that his study was continually thronged either with visitors who
	were persons of distinction, or with clients who came to him for advice;
	and in a short time he acquired a considerable fortune. Notwithstanding
	all these advantages, he passed his life miserably, and ended it on the
	scaffold. The following story afterwards got into circulation, and has
	been often triumphantly cited by succeeding astrologers as an irrefragable
	proof of the truth of their science. It was said that, long before he
	died, he uttered three remarkable prophecies—one relating to himself,
	another to his friend, and the third to his patron, Pandolfo di Malatesta.
	The first delivered was that relating to his friend Guido di Bogni, one of
	the greatest captains of the time. Guido was exceedingly desirous to know
	his fortune, and so importuned Tibertus, that the latter consulted the
	stars and the lines on his palm to satisfy him. He afterwards told him
	with a sorrowful face, that, according to all the rules of astrology and
	palmistry, he should be falsely suspected by his best friend, and should
	lose his life in consequence. Guido then asked the astrologer if he could
	foretell his own fate; upon which Tibertus again consulted the stars, and
	found that it was decreed from all eternity that he should end his days on
	the scaffold. Malatesta, when he heard these predictions, so unlikely, to
	all present appearance, to prove true, desired his astrologer to predict
	his fate also, and to hide nothing from him, however unfavourable it might
	be. Tibertus complied, and told his patron, at that time one of the most
	flourishing <a class="pagenum" id="page249" title="249"></a>and powerful princes of Italy, that he should suffer great
	want, and die at last like a beggar in the common hospital of Bologna. And
	so it happened in all three cases. Guido di Bogni was accused by his own
	father-in-law, the Count di Bentivoglio, of a treasonable design to
	deliver up the city of Rimini to the papal forces, and was assassinated
	afterwards, by order of the tyrant Malatesta, as he sat at the
	supper-table, to which he had been invited in all apparent friendship. The
	astrologer was at the same time thrown into prison, as being concerned in
	the treason of his friend. He attempted to escape, and had succeeded in
	letting himself down from his dungeon-window into a moat, when he was
	discovered by the sentinels. This being reported to Malatesta, he gave
	orders for his execution on the following morning.</p>

	<p>Malatesta had, at this time, no remembrance of the prophecy; and his own
	fate gave him no uneasiness; but events were silently working its
	fulfilment. A conspiracy had been formed, though Guido di Bogni was
	innocent of it, to deliver up Rimini to the pope; and all the necessary
	measures having been taken, the city was seized by the Count de
	Valentinois. In the confusion, Malatesta had barely time to escape from
	his palace in disguise. He was pursued from place to place by his enemies,
	abandoned by all his former friends, and, finally, by his own children. He
	at last fell ill of a languishing disease, at Bologna; and, nobody caring
	to afford him shelter, he was carried to the hospital, where he died. The
	only thing that detracts from the interest of this remarkable story is the
	fact, that the prophecy was made after the event.</p>

	<p>For some weeks before the birth of Louis XIV., an astrologer from Germany,
	who had been sent for by the Marshal de Bassompierre and other noblemen of
	the court, had taken up his residence in the palace, to be ready, at a
	moment’s notice, to draw the horoscope of the future sovereign of France.
	When the queen was taken in labour, he was ushered into a contiguous
	apartment, that he might receive notice of the very instant the child was
	born. The result of his observations were the three words, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">diu, durè,
	feliciter</em>; meaning, that the new-born prince should live and reign long,
	with much labour, and with great glory. No prediction less favourable
	could have been expected from an astrologer, who had his bread to get, and
	who was at the same time a courtier. A medal was afterwards struck in
	commemoration of the event; upon one side of which was figured the
	nativity of the prince, representing him as driving the chariot of Apollo,
	with the inscription “Ortus solis Gallici,”—the rising of the Gallic sun.</p>

	<p>The best excuse ever made for astrology was that offered by the great
	astronomer, Kepler, himself an unwilling practiser of the art.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"></a>He had many applications from his friends to cast nativities for them, and
	generally gave a positive refusal to such as he was not afraid of
	offending by his frankness. In other cases he accommodated himself to the
	prevailing delusion. In sending a copy of his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephemerides</cite> to Professor
	Gerlach, he wrote, that <em>they were nothing but worthless conjectures</em>; but
	he was obliged to devote himself to them, or he would have starved. “Ye
	overwise philosophers,” he exclaimed, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tertius Interveniens</cite>; “ye
	censure this daughter of astronomy beyond her deserts! <em>Know ye not that
	she must support her mother by her charms?</em> The scanty reward of an
	astronomer would not provide him with bread, if men did not entertain
	hopes of reading the future in the heavens.”</p>

	<div class="mancy">
		<p><span class="first_word">Necromancy</span> was, next to astrology, the pretended science most resorted to,
		by those who wished to pry into the future. The earliest instance upon
		record is that of the witch of Endor and the spirit of Samuel. Nearly all
		the nations of antiquity believed in the possibility of summoning departed
		ghosts to disclose the awful secrets that God made clear to the
		disembodied. Many passages in allusion to this subject will at once
		suggest themselves to the classical reader; but this art was never carried
		on openly in any country. All governments looked upon it as a crime of the
		deepest dye. While astrology was encouraged, and its professors courted
		and rewarded, necromancers were universally condemned to the stake or the
		gallows. Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Arnold of Villeneuve, and many
		others, were accused by the public opinion of many centuries, of meddling
		in these unhallowed matters. So deep-rooted has always been the popular
		delusion with respect to accusations of this kind, that no crime was ever
		disproved with such toil and difficulty. That it met great encouragement,
		nevertheless, is evident from the vast numbers of pretenders to it; who,
		in spite of the danger, have existed in all ages and countries.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="mancy">
		<p><span class="first_word">Geomancy</span>, or the art of foretelling the future by means of lines and
		circles, and other mathematical figures drawn on the earth, is still
		extensively practised in Asiatic countries, but is almost unknown in
		Europe.</p>

	<div class="mancy">
		<p><span class="first_word">Augury</span>, from the flight or entrails of birds, so favourite a study among

	<div class="mancy">
		<p><span class="first_word">Divination</span>, of which there are many kinds, boasts a more enduring
		<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"></a>reputation. It has held an empire over the minds of men from the earliest
		periods of recorded history, and is, in all probability, coeval with time
		itself. It was practised alike by the Jews, the Egyptians, the Chaldeans,
		the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans; is equally known to all modern
		nations, in every part of the world; and is not unfamiliar to the
		untutored tribes that roam in the wilds of Africa and America. Divination,
		as practised in civilised Europe at the present day, is chiefly from
		cards, the tea-cup, and the lines on the palm of the hand. Gipsies alone
		make a profession of it; but there are thousands and tens of thousands of
		humble families in which the good-wife, and even the good-man, resort to
		the grounds at the bottom of their tea-cups, to know whether the next
		harvest will be abundant, or their sow bring forth a numerous litter; and
		in which the young maidens look to the same place to know when they are to
		be married, and whether the man of their choice is to be dark or fair,
		rich or poor, kind or cruel. Divination by cards, so great a favourite
		among the moderns, is, of course, a modern science; as cards do not yet
		boast an antiquity of much more than four hundred years. Divination by the
		palm, so confidently believed in by half the village lasses in Europe, is
		of older date, and seems to have been known to the Egyptians in the time
		of the patriarchs; as well as divination by the cup, which, as we are
		informed in Genesis, was practised by Joseph. Divination by the rod was
		also practised by the Egyptians. In comparatively recent times, it was
		pretended that by this means hidden treasures could be discovered. It now
		appears to be altogether exploded in Europe. Onomancy, or the foretelling
		a man’s fate by the letters of his name, and the various transpositions of
		which they are capable, is a more modern sort of divination; but it
		reckons comparatively few believers.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"></a><span class="first_word">Oneiro-Criticism</span>, or the art of interpreting dreams, is a relic of the
		most remote ages, which has subsisted through all the changes that moral
		or physical revolutions have operated in the world. The records of five
		thousand years bear abundant testimony to the universal diffusion of the
		belief, that the skilful could read the future in dreams. The rules of the
		art, if any existed in ancient times, are not known; but in our day, one
		simple rule opens the whole secret. Dreams, say all the wiseacres in
		Christendom, are to be interpreted by contraries. Thus, if you dream of
		filth, you will acquire something valuable; if you dream of the dead, you
		will hear news of the living; if you dream of gold and silver, you run a
		risk of being without either; and if you dream you have many friends, you
		will be persecuted by many enemies. The rule, however, does not hold good
		in all cases. It is fortunate to dream of little pigs, but unfortunate to
		dream of big bullocks. If you dream you have lost a tooth, you may be sure
		that you will shortly lose a friend; and if you dream that your house is
		on fire, you will receive news from a far country. If you dream of vermin,
		it is a sign that there will be sickness in your family; and if you dream
		of serpents, you will have friends who, in the course of time, will prove
		your bitterest enemies; but, of all dreams, it is most fortunate if you
		dream that you are wallowing up to your neck in mud and mire. Clear water
		is a sign of grief; and great troubles, distress, and perplexity are
		predicted, if you dream that you stand naked in the public streets, and
		know not where to find a garment to shield you from the gaze of the
		multitude.</p>

		<p>In many parts of Great Britain, and the continents of Europe and America,
		there are to be found elderly women in the villages and country-places
		whose interpretations of dreams are looked upon with as much reverence as
		if they were oracles. In districts remote from towns it is not uncommon to
		find the members of a family regularly every morning narrating their
		dreams at the breakfast-table, and becoming happy or miserable for the day
		according to their interpretation. There is not a flower that blossoms, or
		fruit that ripens, that, dreamed of, is not ominous of either good or evil
		to such people. Every tree of the field or the forest is endowed with a
		similar influence over the fate of mortals, if seen in the night-visions.
		To dream of the ash, is the sign of a long journey; and of an oak,
		prognosticates long life and prosperity. To dream you stript the bark off
		any tree, is a sign to a maiden of an approaching loss of a character; to
		a married woman, of a family bereavement; and to a man, of an accession of
		fortune. To dream of a leafless tree, is a sign of great sorrow; and of a
		branchless trunk, a sign of despair and suicide. The elder-tree <a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"></a>is more
		auspicious to the sleeper; while the fir-tree, better still, betokens all
		manner of comfort and prosperity. The lime-tree predicts a voyage across
		the ocean; while the yew and the alder are ominous of sickness to the
		young and of death to the old.<a href="#fn62" id="fnm62" title="It is quite astonishing..." class="fnmarker">62</a> Among the flowers and fruits charged
		with messages for the future, the following is a list of the most
		important, arranged from approved sources, in alphabetical order:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><em>Asparagus</em>, gathered and tied up in bundles, is an omen of tears. If you see it growing in your dreams, it is a sign of good fortune.</li>
			<li><em>Aloes</em>, without a flower, betokens long life; in flower, betokens a legacy.</li>
			<li><em>Artichokes</em>. This vegetable is a sign that you will receive, in a short time, a favour from the hands of those from whom you would least expect it.</li>
			<li><em>Agrimony</em>. This herb denotes that there will be sickness in your house.</li>
			<li><em>Anemone</em> predicts love.</li>
			<li><em>Auriculas</em>, in beds, denote luck; in pots, marriage; while to gather them, foretells widowhood.</li>
			<li><em>Bilberries</em> predict a pleasant excursion.</li>
			<li><em>Broom-flowers</em> an increase of family.</li>
			<li><em>Cauliflowers</em> predict that all your friends will slight you, or that you will fall into poverty and find no one to pity you.</li>
			<li><em>Dock-leaves</em>, a present from the country.</li>
			<li><em>Daffodils</em>. Any maiden who dreams of daffodils is warned by her good angel to avoid going into a wood with her lover, or into any dark or retired place where she might not be able to make people hear her if she cried out. Alas for her if she pay no attention to the warning!</li>
			<li>
				<div class="poem">
					<p>“Never again shall she put garland on;</p>
					<p>Instead of it she’ll wear sad cypress now,</p>
					<p>And bitter elder broken from the bough.”</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255"></a><em>Figs</em>, if green, betoken embarrassment; if dried, money to the poor, and mirth to the rich.</li>
			<li><em>Hearts-ease</em> betokens heart’s pain.</li>
			<li><em>Lilies</em> predict joy; <em>water-lilies</em>, danger from the sea.</li>
			<li><em>Lemons</em> betoken a separation.</li>
			<li><em>Pomegranates</em> predict happy wedlock to those who are single, and reconciliation to those who are married and have disagreed.</li>
			<li><em>Quinces</em> prognosticate pleasant company.</li>
			<li><em>Roses</em> denote happy love, not unmixed with sorrow from other sources.</li>
			<li><em>Sorrel</em>. To dream of this herb is a sign that you will shortly have occasion to exert all your prudence to overcome some great calamity.</li>
			<li><em>Sunflowers</em> shew that your pride will be deeply wounded.</li>
			<li><em>Violets</em> predict evil to the single, and joy to the married.</li>
			<li><em>Yellow-flowers</em> of any kind predict jealousy.</li>
			<li><em>Yew-berries</em> predict loss of character to both sexes.</li>

	<p>It should be observed that the rules for the interpretation of dreams are
	far from being universal. The cheeks of the peasant girl of England glow
	with pleasure in the morning after she has dreamed of a rose, while the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paysanne</em> of Normandy dreads disappointment and vexation for the very
	same reason. The Switzer who dreams of an oak-tree does not share in the
	Englishman’s joy; for he imagines that the vision was a warning to him
	that, from some trifling cause, an overwhelming calamity will burst over
	him. Thus do the ignorant and the credulous torment themselves; thus do
	they spread their nets to catch vexation, and pass their lives between
	hopes which are of no value and fears which are a positive evil.</p>

	<div class="mancy">
		<p><span class="first_word">Omens</span>. Among the other means of self-annoyance upon which men have
		stumbled, in their vain hope of discovering the future, signs and omens
		hold a conspicuous place. There is scarcely an occurrence in nature which,
		happening at a certain time, is not looked upon by some persons as a
		prognosticator either of good or evil. The latter are in the greatest
		number, so much more ingenious are we in tormenting ourselves than in
		discovering reasons for enjoyment in the things that surround us. We go
		out of our course to make ourselves uncomfortable; the cup of life is not
		bitter enough to our palate, and we distil superfluous poison to put into
		it, or conjure up hideous things to frighten ourselves at, which would
		never exist if we did not make them. “We suffer,” says Addison,<a href="#fn63" id="fnm63" title="Spectator..." class="fnmarker">63</a> “as
		much from <a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256"></a>trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known the shooting
		of a star spoil a night’s rest, and have seen a man in love grow pale and
		lose his appetite upon the plucking of a merrythought. A screech-owl at
		midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice
		of a cricket has struck more terror than the roaring of a lion. There is
		nothing so inconsiderable which may not appear dreadful to an imagination
		that is filled with omens and prognostics. A rusty nail or a crooked pin
		shoot up into prodigies.”</p>

		<p>The century and a quarter that has passed away since Addison wrote has
		seen the fall of many errors. Many fallacies and delusions have been
		crushed under the foot of Time since then; but this has been left
		unscathed, to frighten the weak-minded and embitter their existence. A
		belief in omens is not confined to the humble and uninformed. A general
		who led an army with credit has been known to feel alarmed at a
		winding-sheet in the candle; and learned men, who had honourably and
		fairly earned the highest honours of literature, have been seen to gather
		their little ones around them, and fear that one would be snatched away,
		because,</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<p>“When stole upon the time the dead of night,</p>
			<p>And heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes,”</p>
		</div>

		<p class="continued_paragraph">a dog in the street was howling at the moon. Persons who would acknowledge
		freely that the belief in omens was unworthy of a man of sense, have yet
		confessed at the same time that, in spite of their reason, they have been
		unable to conquer their fears of death when they heard the harmless insect
		called the death-watch ticking in the wall, or saw an oblong hollow coal
		fly out of the fire.</p>

		<p>Many other evil omens besides those mentioned above alarm the vulgar and
		the weak. If a sudden shivering comes over such people, they believe that,
		at that instant, an enemy is treading over the spot that will one day be
		their grave. If they meet a sow when they first walk abroad in the
		morning, it is an omen of evil for that day. To meet an ass, is in like
		manner unlucky. It is also very unfortunate to walk under a ladder; to
		forget to eat goose on the festival of St. Michael; to tread upon a
		beetle, or to eat the twin nuts that are sometimes found in one shell.
		Woe, in like manner, is predicted to that wight who inadvertently upsets
		the salt; each grain that is overthrown will bring to him a day of sorrow.
		If thirteen persons sit at table, one of them will die within the year;
		and all of them will be unhappy. Of all evil omens this is the worst. The
		facetious Dr. Kitchener used to observe that there was one case in which
		he believed that it was really unlucky for thirteen persons to sit down to
		dinner, and that was when there was only dinner enough for twelve.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257"></a>Unfortunately for their peace of mind, the great majority of people do not
		take this wise view of the matter. In almost every country of Europe the
		same superstition prevails, and some carry it so far as to look upon the
		number thirteen as in every way ominous of evil; and if they find thirteen
		coins in their purse, cast away the odd one like a polluted thing. The
		philosophic Beranger, in his exquisite song, <cite>Thirteen at Table</cite>, has
		taken a poetical view of this humiliating superstition, and mingled, as is
		his wont, a lesson of genuine wisdom in his lay. Being at dinner, he
		overthrows the salt, and, looking round the room, discovers that he is the
		thirteenth guest. While he is mourning his unhappy fate, and conjuring up
		visions of disease and suffering and the grave, he is suddenly startled by
		the apparition of Death herself, not in the shape of a grim foe, with
		skeleton-ribs and menacing dart, but of an angel of light, who shews the
		folly of tormenting ourselves with the dread of her approach, when she is
		the friend, rather than the enemy, of man, and frees us from the fetters
		which bind us to the dust.</p>

		<p>If men could bring themselves to look upon death in this manner, living
		well and wisely till her inevitable approach, how vast a store of grief
		and vexation would they spare themselves!</p>

		<p>Among good omens, one of the most conspicuous is to meet a piebald horse.
		To meet two of these animals is still more fortunate; and if on such an
		occasion you spit thrice, and form any reasonable wish, it will be
		gratified within three days. It is also a sign of good fortune if you
		inadvertently put on your stocking wrong side out. If you wilfully wear
		your stocking in this fashion, no good will come of it. It is very lucky
		to sneeze twice; but if you sneeze a third time, the omen loses its power,
		and your good fortune will be nipped in the bud. If a strange dog follow
		you, and fawn on you, and wish to attach itself to you, it is a sign of
		very great prosperity. Just as fortunate is it if a strange male cat comes
		to your house and manifests friendly intentions towards your family. If a
		she cat, it is an omen, on the contrary, of very great misfortune. If a
		swarm of bees alight in your garden, some very high honour and great joys
		await you.</p>

		<p>Besides these glimpses of the future, you may know something of your fate
		by a diligent attention to every itching that you may feel in your body.
		Thus, if the eye or the nose itches, it is a sign you will be shortly
		vexed; if the foot itches, you will tread upon strange ground; and if the
		elbow itches, you will change your bedfellow. Itching of the right hand
		prognosticates that you will soon have a sum of money; and, of the left,
		that you will be called upon to disburse it.</p>

		<p>These are but a few of the omens which are generally credited in <a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258"></a>modern
		Europe. A complete list of them would fatigue from its length, and sicken
		from its absurdity. It would be still more unprofitable to attempt to
		specify the various delusions of the same kind which are believed among
		oriental nations. Every reader will remember the comprehensive formula of
		cursing preserved in <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>—curse a man after any fashion you
		remember or can invent, you will be sure to find it there. The oriental
		creed of omens is not less comprehensive. Every movement of the body,
		every emotion of the mind, is at certain times an omen. Every form and
		object in nature, even the shape of the clouds and the changes of the
		weather; every colour, every sound, whether of men or animals, or birds or
		insects, or inanimate things, is an omen. Nothing is too trifling or
		inconsiderable to inspire a hope which is not worth cherishing, or a fear
		which is sufficient to embitter existence.</p>

		<p>From the belief in omens springs the superstition that has, from very
		early ages, set apart certain days, as more favourable than others, for
		prying into the secrets of futurity. The following, copied verbatim from
		the popular <cite>Dream and Omen Book</cite> of Mother Bridget, will shew the belief
		of the people of England at the present day. Those who are curious as to
		the ancient history of these observances, will find abundant aliment in
		the <cite>Every-day Book</cite>.</p>

				<p>Let me know my fate, whether weal or woe;</p>
				<p>Whether my rank’s to be high or low;</p>
				<p>Whether to live single, or be a bride,</p>
				<p>And the destiny my star doth provide.’</p>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">Should you have no dream that night, you will be single and miserable all

			great difficulty and sorrow.</p>

			<p>“<em>Candlemas Eve.</em>—On this night (which is the purification of the Virgin
			Mary), let three, five, seven, or nine young maidens assemble together in
			a square chamber. Hang in each corner a bundle of sweet herbs, mixed with
			rue and rosemary. Then mix a cake of flour, olive-oil, and white sugar;
			every maiden having an equal share in the making and the expense of it.
			Afterwards it must be cut into equal pieces, each one marking the piece as
			she cuts it with the initials of her name. It is then to be baked one hour
			before the fire, not a word being spoken the whole time, and the maidens
			sitting with their arms and knees across. Each piece of cake is then to be
			wrapped up in a sheet of paper, on which each maiden shall write the love
			part of Solomon’s Songs. If she put this under her pillow she will dream
			true. She will see her future husband and every one of her children, and
			will know besides whether her family will be poor or prosperous, a comfort
			to her or the contrary.</p>

			<p>“<em>Midsummer.</em>—Take three roses, smoke them with sulphur, and exactly at
			three in the day bury one of the roses under a yew-tree; the second in a
			newly-made grave, and put the third under your pillow for three nights,
			and at the end of that period burn it in a fire of charcoal. Your dreams
			during that time will be prophetic of your future destiny, and, what is
			still more curious and valuable, says Mother Bridget, the man whom you are
			to wed will enjoy no peace till he comes and visits you. Besides this, you
			will perpetually haunt his dreams.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page260" title="260"></a>“<em>St. John’s Eve.</em>—Make a new pincushion of the very best black velvet
			(no inferior quality will answer the purpose), and on one side stick your
			name at full length with the very smallest pins that can be bought (none
			other will do). On the other side make a cross with some very large pins,
			and surround it with a circle. Put this into your stocking when you take
			it off at night, and hang it up at the foot of the bed. All your future
			life will pass before you in a dream.</p>

			<p>“<em>First New Moon of the year.</em>—On the first new moon in the year take a
			pint of clear spring water, and infuse into it the <em>white</em> of an egg laid
			by a <em>white</em> hen, a glass of <em>white</em> wine, three almonds peeled <em>white</em>,
			and a tablespoonful of <em>white</em> rose-water. Drink this on going to bed, not
			making more nor less than three draughts of it; repeating the following
			verses three several times in a clear distinct voice, but not so loud as
			to be overheard by any body:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			<p>‘If I dream of water pure</p>
			<p class="i2">Before the coming morn,</p>
			<p>’Tis a sign I shall be poor,</p>
			<p class="i2">And unto wealth not born.</p>

	<p>We have now taken a hasty review of the various modes of seeking to
	discover the future, especially as practised in modern times. The main
	features of the folly appear essentially the same in all countries.
	National character and peculiarities operate some difference <a class="pagenum" id="page261" title="261"></a>of
	interpretation. The mountaineer makes the natural phenomena which he most
	frequently witnesses prognosticative of the future. The dweller in the
	plains, in a similar manner, seeks to know his fate among the signs of the
	things that surround him, and tints his superstition with the hues of his
	own clime. The same spirit animates them all—the same desire to know that
	which Infinite Mercy has concealed. There is but little probability that
	the curiosity of mankind in this respect will ever be wholly eradicated.
	Death and ill fortune are continual bugbears to the weak-minded, the
	irreligious, and the ignorant; and while such exist in the world, divines
	will preach upon its impiety and philosophers discourse upon its absurdity
	in vain. Still it is evident that these follies have greatly diminished.
	Soothsayers and prophets have lost the credit they formerly enjoyed, and
	skulk in secret now where they once shewed their faces in the blaze of
	day. So far there is manifest improvement.</p>

		<span class="first_word">The</span> wonderful influence of imagination in the cure of diseases is well
	known. A motion of the hand, or a glance of the eye, will throw a weak and
	credulous patient into a fit; and a pill made of bread, if taken with
	sufficient faith, will operate a cure better than all the drugs in the
	pharmacopœia. The Prince of Orange, at the siege of Breda, in 1625, cured
	all his soldiers, who were dying of the scurvy, by a philanthropic piece
	of quackery, which he played upon them with the knowledge of the
	physicians, when all other means had failed.<a href="#fn64" id="fnm64" title="See Van der Mye's..." class="fnmarker">64</a> Many hundreds of
	instances, of a similar kind, might be related, especially from the
	history of witchcraft. The mummeries, strange gesticulations, and
	barbarous jargon of witches and sorcerers, which frightened credulous and
	nervous women, brought on all those symptoms of hysteria and other similar
	diseases, so well understood now, but which were then supposed to be the
	work of the Devil, not only by the victims and the public in general, but
	by the operators themselves.</p>

	<p>In the age when alchymy began to fall into some disrepute, and learning to
	lift up its voice against <a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263"></a>it, a new delusion, based upon this
	power of imagination, suddenly arose, and found apostles among all the
	alchymists. Numbers of them, forsaking their old pursuits, made themselves
	magnetisers. It appeared first in the shape of mineral, and afterwards of
	animal, magnetism, under which latter name it survives to this day, and
	numbers its dupes by thousands.</p>

	<p>The mineral magnetisers claim the first notice, as the worthy predecessors
	of the quacks of the present day. The honour claimed for Paracelsus, of
	being the first of the Rosicrucians, has been disputed; but his claim to
	be considered the first of the magnetisers can scarcely be challenged. It
	has been already mentioned of him, in the part of this work which treats
	of alchymy, that, like nearly all the distinguished adepts, he was a
	physician; and pretended, not only to make gold and confer immortality,
	but to cure all diseases. He was the first who, with the latter view,
	attributed occult and miraculous powers to the magnet. Animated apparently
	by a sincere conviction that the magnet was the philosopher’s stone,
	which, if it could not transmute metals, could soothe all human suffering
	and arrest the progress of decay, he travelled for many years in Persia
	and Arabia, in search of the mountain of adamant, so famed in oriental
	fables. When he practised as a physician at Basle, he called one of his
	nostrums by the name of azoth—a stone or crystal, which, he said,
	contained magnetic properties, and cured epilepsy, hysteria, and spasmodic
	affections. He soon found imitators. His fame spread far and near; and
	thus were sown the first seeds of that error which has since taken root
	and flourished so widely. In spite of the denial of modern practitioners,
	this must be considered the origin of magnetism; for we find that,
	beginning with Paracelsus, there was a regular succession of mineral
	magnetisers until Mesmer appeared, and gave a new feature to the delusion.</p>

	<p>Paracelsus boasted of being able to <em>transplant</em> diseases from the human
	frame into the earth, by means of the magnet. He said there were six ways
	by which this might be effected. One of them will be quite sufficient as a
	specimen. “If a person suffer from disease, either local or general, let
	the following remedy be tried. Take a magnet, impregnated with mummy,<a href="#fn65" id="fnm65" title="Mummies were of several..." class="fnmarker">65</a>
	and mixed with rich earth. In <a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264"></a>this earth sow some seeds that have
	a congruity or homogeneity with the disease; then let this earth, well
	sifted and mixed with mummy, be laid in an earthen vessel; and let the
	seeds committed to it be watered daily with a lotion in which the diseased
	limb or body has been washed. Thus will the disease be transplanted from
	the human body to the seeds which are in the earth. Having done this,
	transplant the seeds from the earthen vessel to the ground, and wait till
	they begin to sprout into herbs; as they increase, the disease will
	diminish; and when they have arrived at their full growth, it will
	disappear altogether.”</p>

	<p>Kircher the Jesuit, whose quarrel with the alchymists was the means of
	exposing many of their impostures, was a firm believer in the efficacy of
	the magnet. Having been applied to by a patient afflicted with hernia, he
	directed the man to swallow a small magnet reduced to powder, while he
	applied at the same time to the external swelling, a poultice made of
	filings of iron. He expected that by this means the magnet, when it got to
	the corresponding place inside, would draw in the iron, and with it the
	tumour; which would thus, he said, be safely and expeditiously reduced.</p>

	<p>As this new doctrine of magnetism spread, it was found that wounds
	inflicted with any metallic substance could be cured by the magnet. In
	process of time, the delusion so increased, that it was deemed sufficient
	to magnetise a sword, to cure any hurt which that sword might have
	inflicted! This was the origin of the celebrated “weapon-salve,” which
	excited so much attention about the middle of the seventeenth century. The
	following was the recipe given by Paracelsus for the cure of any wounds
	inflicted by a sharp weapon, except such as had penetrated the heart, the
	brain, or the arteries. “Take of moss growing on the head of a thief who
	has been hanged and left in the air; of real mummy; of human blood, still
	warm—of each, one ounce; of human suet, two ounces; of linseed oil,
	turpentine, and Armenian bole—of each, two drachms. Mix all well in a
	mortar, and keep the salve in an oblong, narrow urn.” With this salve the
	weapon, after being dipped in the blood from the wound, was to be
	carefully anointed, and then laid by in a cool place. In the mean time,
	the wound was to be duly washed with fair clean water, covered with a
	clean, soft, linen rag, and opened once a day to cleanse off purulent or
	other matter. Of the success of this treatment, says <a class="pagenum" id="page265" title="265"></a>the writer of
	the able article on Animal Magnetism, in the twelfth volume of the
	<cite>Foreign Quarterly Review</cite>, there cannot be the least doubt; “for surgeons
	at this moment follow exactly the same method, <em>except</em> anointing the
	weapon!”</p>

	<p>The weapon-salve continued to be much spoken of on the Continent, and many
	eager claimants appeared for the honour of the invention. Dr. Fludd, or A.
	Fluctibus, the Rosicrucian, who has been already mentioned in a previous
	part of this volume, was very zealous in introducing it into England. He
	tried it with great success in several cases, and no wonder, for while he
	kept up the spirits of his patients by boasting of the great efficacy of
	the salve, he never neglected those common, but much more important
	remedies, of washing, bandaging, &amp;c. which the experience of all ages had
	declared sufficient for the purpose. Fludd moreover declared, that the
	magnet was a remedy for all diseases, if properly applied; but that man
	having, like the earth, a north and a south pole, magnetism could only
	take place when his body was in a boreal position! In the midst of his
	popularity, an attack was made upon him and his favourite remedy, the
	salve; which, however, did little or nothing to diminish the belief in its
	efficacy. One “Parson Foster” wrote a pamphlet, entitled <cite>Hyplocrisma
	Spongus; or, a Spunge to wipe away the Weapon-Salve</cite>; in which he
	declared, that it was as bad as witchcraft to use or recommend such an
	unguent; that it was invented by the Devil, who, at the last day, would
	seize upon every person who had given it the slightest encouragement. “In
	fact,” said Parson Foster, “the Devil himself gave it to Paracelsus;
	Paracelsus to the emperor; the emperor to the courtier; the courtier to
	Baptista Porta; and Baptista Porta to Dr. Fludd, a doctor of physic, yet
	living and practising in the famous city of London, who now stands tooth
	and nail for it.” Dr. Fludd, thus assailed, took up the pen in defence of
	his unguent, in a reply called <cite>The Squeezing of Parson Foster’s Spunge;
	wherein the Spunge-bearer’s immodest carriage and behaviour towards his
	brethren is detected; the bitter flames of his slanderous reports are, by
	the sharp vinegar of truth, corrected and quite extinguished; and lastly,
	the virtuous validity of his spunge in wiping away the-weapon-salve, is
	crushed out and clean abolished</cite>.</p>

	<p>Shortly after this dispute a more distinguished believer in the
	weapon-salve made his appearance in the person of Sir Kenelm Digby, the
	son of Sir Everard Digby, who was executed for his participation in the
	Gunpowder Plot. This gentleman, who, in other respects, was an
	accomplished scholar and an able man, was imbued with all the extravagant
	notions of the alchymists. He believed in the philosopher’s stone, and
	wished to engage Descartes to devote his energies <a class="pagenum" id="page266" title="266"></a>to the discovery
	of the elixir of life, or some other means by which the existence of man
	might be prolonged to an indefinite period. He gave his wife, the
	beautiful Venetia Anastasia Stanley, a dish of capons fed upon vipers,
	according to the plan supposed to have been laid down by Arnold of
	Villeneuve, in the hope that she might thereby preserve her loveliness for
	a century. If such a man once took up the idea of the weapon-salve, it was
	to be expected that he would make the most of it. In his hands, however,
	it was changed from an unguent into a powder, and was called the <em>powder
	of sympathy</em>. He pretended that he had acquired the knowledge of it from a
	Carmelite friar, who had learned it in Persia or Armenia, from an oriental
	philosopher of great renown. King James, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of
	Buchingham, and many other noble personages, believed in its efficacy. The
	following remarkable instance of his mode of cure was read by Sir Kenelm
	to a society of learned men at Montpellier. Mr. James Howell, the
	well-known author of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendrologia</cite>, and of various letters, coming by
	chance as two of his best friends were fighting a duel, rushed between
	them and endeavoured to part them. He seized the sword of one of the
	combatants by the hilt, while, at the same time, he grasped the other by
	the blade. Being transported with fury one against the other, they
	struggled to rid themselves of the hindrance caused by their friend; and
	in so doing, the one whose sword was held by the blade by Mr. Howell, drew
	it away roughly, and nearly cut his hand off, severing the nerves and
	muscles, and penetrating to the bone. The other, almost at the same
	instant, disengaged his sword, and aimed a blow at the head of his
	antagonist, which Mr. Howell observing, raised his wounded hand with the
	rapidity of thought to prevent the blow. The sword fell on the back of his
	already wounded hand, and cut it severely. “It seemed,” said Sir Kenelm
	Digby, “as if some unlucky star raged over them, that they should have
	both shed the blood of that dear friend for whose life they would have
	given their own, if they had been in their proper mind at the time.”
	Seeing Mr. Howell’s face all besmeared with blood from his wounded hand,
	they both threw down their swords and embraced him, and bound up his hand
	with a garter, to close the veins which were cut and bled profusely. They
	then conveyed him home, and sent for a surgeon. King James, who was much
	attached to Mr. Howell, afterwards sent his own surgeon to attend him. We
	must continue the narrative in the words of Sir Kenelm Digby: “It was my
	chance,” says he, “to be lodged hard by him; and four or five days after,
	as I was making myself ready, he came to my house, and prayed me to view
	his wounds. ‘For I understand,’ said he, ‘that you have extraordinary
	remedies on such <a class="pagenum" id="page267" title="267"></a>occasions; and my surgeons apprehend some fear
	that it may grow to a gangrene, and so the hand must be cut off.’ In
	effect, his countenance discovered that he was in much pain, which, he
	said, was insupportable in regard of the extreme inflammation. I told him
	I would willingly serve him; but if, haply, he knew the manner how I could
	cure him, without touching or seeing him, it might be that he would not
	expose himself to my manner of curing; because he would think it,
	peradventure, either ineffectual or superstitious. He replied, ‘The many
	wonderful things which people have related unto me of your way of
	medicinement makes me nothing doubt at all of its efficacy; and all that I
	have to say unto you is comprehended in the Spanish proverb, <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hagase el
	milagro y hagalo Mahoma</em>—Let the miracle be done, though Mahomet do it.’</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“I asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it: so he
		presently sent for his garter, wherewith his hand was first bound; and as
		I called for a basin of water, as if I would wash my hands, I took a
		handful of powder of vitriol, which I had in my study, and presently
		dissolved it. As soon as the bloody garter was brought me, I put it in the
		basin, observing, in the interim, what Mr. Howell did, who stood talking
		with a gentleman in a corner of my chamber, not regarding at all what I
		was doing. He started suddenly, as if he had found some strange alteration
		in himself. I asked him what he ailed? ‘I know not what ails me, but I
		find that I feel no more pain. Methinks that a pleasing kind of freshness,
		as it were a wet cold napkin, did spread over my hand, which hath taken
		away the inflammation that tormented me before.’ I replied, ‘Since, then,
		you feel already so much good of my medicament, I advise you to cast away
		all your plasters; only keep the wound clean, and in a moderate temper
		betwixt heat and cold.’ This was presently reported to the Duke of
		Buckingham, and, a little after, to the king, who were both very curious
		to know the circumstances of the business; which was, that after dinner I
		took the garter out of the water, and put it to dry before a great fire.
		It was scarce dry before Mr. Howell’s servant came running, and saying
		that his master felt as much burning as ever he had done, if not more; for
		the heat was such as if his hand were betwixt coals of fire. I answered
		that, although that had happened at present, yet he should find ease in a
		short time; for I knew the reason of this new accident, and would provide
		accordingly; for his master should be free from that inflammation, it
		might be before he could possibly return to him. But, in case he found no
		ease, I wished him to come presently back again; if not, he might forbear
		coming. Thereupon he went, and, at the <a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268"></a>instant I did put the
		garter again into the water; thereupon he found his master without any
		pain at all. To be brief, there was no cense of pain afterwards; but
		within five or six days the wounds were sicatrised and entirely healed.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Such is the marvellous story of Sir Kenelm Digby. Other practitioners of
	that age were not behind him in their pretensions. It was not always
	thought necessary to use either the powder of sympathy, or the
	weapon-salve, to effect a cure. It was sufficient to magnetise the sword
	with the hand (the first faint dawn of the <em>animal</em> theory), to relieve
	any pain the same weapon had caused. They asserted, that if they stroked
	the sword <em>upwards</em> with their fingers, the wounded person would feel
	immediate relief; but if they stroked it <em>downwards</em>, he would feel
	intolerable pain.<a href="#fn66" id="fnm66" title="Reginald Scott..." class="fnmarker">66</a></p>

	<p>Another very singular notion of the power and capabilities of magnetism
	was entertained at the same time. It was believed that a <em>sympathetic
	alphabet</em> could be made on the flesh, by means of which persons could
	correspond with each other, and communicate all their ideas with the
	rapidity of volition, although thousands of miles apart. From the arms of
	two persons a piece of flesh was cut, and mutually transplanted, while
	still warm and bleeding. The piece so severed grew to the new arm on which
	it was placed; but still retained so close a sympathy with its native
	limb, that its old possessor was always sensible of any injury done to it.
	Upon these transplanted pieces were tatooed the letters of the alphabet;
	so that, when a communication was to be made, either of the persons,
	though the wide Atlantic rolled between them, had only to prick his arm
	with a magnetic needle, and straightway his friend received intimation
	that the telegraph was at work. Whatever letter he pricked on his own arm
	pained the same letter on the arm of his correspondent.</p>

	<p>Contemporary with Sir Kenelm Digby was the no less famous Mr. Valentine
	Greatraks, who, without mentioning magnetism, or laying claim to any
	theory, practised upon himself and others a deception much more akin to
	the animal magnetism of the present day than the mineral magnetism it was
	then so much the fashion to study. He was the son of an Irish gentleman,
	of good education and property, in the county of Cork. He fell, at an
	early age, into a sort of melancholy derangement. After some time he had
	an impulse, or strange persuasion in his mind, which continued to present
	itself, whether he were sleeping or waking, that God had given him the
	power of curing the king’s evil. He mentioned this persuasion to his <a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269"></a>wife,
	who very candidly told him that he was a fool. He was not quite sure of
	this, notwithstanding the high authority from which it came, and
	determined to make trial of the power that was in him. A few days
	afterwards, he went to one William Maher, of Saltersbridge, in the parish
	of Lismore, who was grievously afflicted with the king’s evil in his eyes,
	cheek, and throat. Upon this man, who was of abundant faith, he laid his
	hands, stroked him, and prayed fervently. He had the satisfaction to see
	him heal considerably in the course of a few days; and finally, with the
	aid of other remedies, to be quite cured. This success encouraged him in
	the belief that he had a divine mission. Day after day he had further
	impulses from on high that he was called upon to cure the ague also. In
	the course of time he extended his powers to the curing of epilepsy,
	ulcers, aches, and lameness. All the county of Cork was in a commotion to
	see this extraordinary physician, who certainly operated some very great
	benefit in cases where the disease was heightened by hypochondria and
	depression of spirits. According to his own account,<a href="#fn67" id="fnm67" title="Greatraks' Account..." class="fnmarker">67</a> such great
	multitudes resorted to him from divers places, that he had no time to
	follow his own business, or enjoy the company of his family and friends.
	He was obliged to set aside three days in the week, from six in the
	morning till six at night, during which time only he laid hands upon all
	that came. Still the crowds which thronged around him were so great, that
	the neighbouring towns were not able to accommodate them. He thereupon
	left his house in the country, and went to Youghal, where the resort of
	sick people, not only from all parts of Ireland, but from England,
	continued so great, that the magistrates were afraid they would infect the
	place by their diseases. Several of these poor credulous people no sooner
	saw him than they fell into fits, and he restored them by waving his hand
	in their faces, and praying over them. Nay, he affirmed that the touch of
	his glove had driven pains away, and, on one occasion, cast out from a
	woman several devils, or evil spirits, who tormented her day and night.
	“Every one of these devils,” says Greatraks, “was like to choke her when
	it came up into her throat.” It is evident from this that the woman’s
	complaint was nothing but hysteria.</p>

	<p>The clergy of the diocese of Lismore, who seem to have had much clearer
	notions of Greatraks’ pretensions than their parishioners, set their faces
	against the new prophet and worker of miracles. He was cited to appear in
	the Dean’s Court, and prohibited from laying on his hands for the future:
	but he cared nothing for the Church. He imagined that he derived his
	powers direct from heaven, and continued <a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270"></a>to throw people into
	fits, and bring them to their senses again, as usual, almost exactly after
	the fashion of modern magnetisers. His reputation became, at last, so
	great, that Lord Conway sent to him from London, begging that he would
	come over immediately to cure a grievous headache which his lady had
	suffered for several years, and which the principal physicians of England
	had been unable to relieve.</p>

	<p>Greatraks accepted the invitation, and tried his manipulations and prayers
	upon Lady Conway. He failed, however, in affording any relief. The poor
	lady’s headache was excited by causes too serious to allow her any help,
	even from faith and a lively imagination. He lived for some months in Lord
	Conway’s house, at Ragley, in Warwickshire, operating cures similar to
	those he had performed in Ireland. He afterwards removed to London, and
	took a house in Lincoln’s-Inn Fields, which soon became the daily resort
	of all the nervous and credulous women of the metropolis. A very amusing
	account of Greatraks at this time (1665) is given in the second volume of
	the <cite>Miscellanies of St. Evremond</cite>, under the title of the Irish prophet.
	It is the most graphic sketch ever made of this early magnetiser. Whether
	his pretensions were more or less absurd than those of some of his
	successors, who have lately made their appearance among us, would be hard
	to say.</p>

	<p>“When M. de Comminges,” says St. Evremond, “was ambassador from his most
	Christian majesty to the king of Great Britain, there came to London an
	Irish prophet, who passed himself off as a great worker of miracles. Some
	persons of quality having begged M. de Comminges to invite him to his
	house, that they might be witnesses of some of his miracles, the
	ambassador promised to satisfy them, as much to gratify his own curiosity
	as from courtesy to his friends; and gave notice to Greatraks that he
	would be glad to see him.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“A rumour of the prophet’s coming soon spread all over the town, and the
		hotel of M. de Comminges was crowded by sick persons, who came full of
		confidence in their speedy cure. The Irishman made them wait a
		considerable time for him, but came at last, in the midst of their
		impatience, with a grave and simple countenance, that showed no signs of
		his being a cheat. Monsieur de Comminges prepared to question him
		strictly, hoping to discourse with him on the matters that he had read of
		in Van Helmont and Bodinus; but he was not able to do so, much to his
		regret, for the crowd became so great, and cripples and others pressed
		around so impatiently to be the first cured, that the servants were
		obliged to use threats, and even force, before <a class="pagenum" id="page271" title="271"></a>they could
		establish order among them, or place them in proper ranks.</p>

		<p>“The prophet affirmed that all diseases were caused by evil spirits. Every
		infirmity was with him a case of diabolical possession. The first that was
		presented to him was a man suffering from gout and rheumatism, and so
		severely that the physicians had been unable to cure him. ‘Ah,’ said the
		miracle-worker, ‘I have seen a good deal of this sort of spirits when I
		was in Ireland. They are watery spirits, who bring on cold shivering, and
		excite an overflow of aqueous humours in our poor bodies.’ Then addressing
		the man, he said, ‘Evil spirit, who hast quitted thy dwelling in the
		waters to come and afflict this miserable body, I command thee to quit thy
		new abode, and to return to thine ancient habitation!’ This said, the sick
		man was ordered to withdraw, and another was brought forward in his place.
		This new comer said he was tormented by the melancholy vapours. In fact,
		he looked like a hypochondriac; one of those persons, diseased in
		imagination, and who but too often become so in reality. ‘Aerial spirit,’
		said the Irishman, ‘return, I command thee, into the air;—exercise thy
		natural vocation of raising tempests, and do not excite any more wind in
		this sad unlucky body!’ This man was immediately turned away to make room
		for a third patient, who, in the Irishman’s opinion, was only tormented by
		a little bit of a sprite, who could not withstand his command for an
		instant. He pretended that he recognised this sprite by some marks which
		were invisible to the company, to whom he turned with a smile, and said,
		‘This sort of spirit does not often do much harm, and is always very
		diverting.’ To hear him talk, one would have imagined that he knew all
		about spirits,—their names, their rank, their numbers, their employment,
		and all the functions they were destined to; and he boasted of being much
		better acquainted with the intrigues of demons than he was with the
		affairs of men. You can hardly imagine what a reputation he gained in a
		short time. Catholics and Protestants visited him from every part, all
		believing that power from heaven was in his hands.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>After relating a rather equivocal adventure of a husband and wife, who
	implored Greatraks to cast out the devil of dissension which had crept in
	between them, St. Evremond thus sums up the effect he produced on the
	popular mind: “So great was the confidence in him, that the blind fancied
	they saw the light which they did not see—the deaf imagined that they
	heard—the lame that they walked straight, and the paralytic that they had
	recovered the use of their limbs. An idea of health made the sick forget
	for a while their maladies; <a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272"></a>and imagination, which was not less
	active in those merely drawn by curiosity than in the sick, gave a false
	view to the one class, from the desire of seeing, as it operated a false
	cure on the other from the strong desire of being healed. Such was the
	power of the Irishman over the mind, and such was the influence of the
	mind upon the body. Nothing was spoken of in London but his prodigies; and
	these prodigies were supported by such great authorities, that the
	bewildered multitude believed them almost without examination, while more
	enlightened people did not dare to reject them from their own knowledge.
	The public opinion, timid and enslaved, respected this imperious and,
	apparently, well-authenticated error. Those who saw through the delusion
	kept their opinion to themselves, knowing how useless it was to declare
	their disbelief to a people filled with prejudice and admiration.”</p>

	<p>About the same time that Valentine Greatraks was thus <em>magnetising</em> the
	people of London, an Italian enthusiast, named Francisco Bagnone, was
	performing the same tricks in Italy, and with as great success. He had
	only to touch weak women with his hands, or sometimes (for the sake of
	working more effectively upon their fanaticism) with a relic, to make them
	fall into fits, and manifest all the symptoms of magnetism.</p>

	<p>Besides these, several learned men, in different parts of Europe, directed
	their attention to the study of the magnet, believing that it might be
	rendered efficacious in many diseases. Van Helmont, in particular,
	published a work on the effects of magnetism on the human frame; and
	Balthazar Gracian, a Spaniard, rendered himself famous for the boldness of
	his views on the subject. “The magnet,” said the latter, “attracts iron;
	iron is found every where; every thing, therefore, is under the influence
	of magnetism. It is only a modification of the general principle, which
	establishes harmony or foments divisions among men. It is the same agent
	that gives rise to sympathy, antipathy, and the passions.”<a href="#fn68" id="fnm68" title="Introduction to the Study..." class="fnmarker">68</a></p>

	<p>Baptista Porta, who, in the whimsical genealogy of the weapon-salve, given
	by Parson Foster, in his attack upon Dr. à Fluctibus, is mentioned as one
	of its fathers, had also great faith in the efficacy of the magnet, and
	operated upon the imagination of his patients in a manner which was then
	considered so extraordinary that he was accused of being a magician, and
	prohibited from practising by the court of Rome. Among others who
	distinguished themselves by their faith in magnetism, Sebastian Wirdig and
	William Maxwell claim especial notice. Wirdig was professor of medicine at
	the university of <a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273"></a>Rostock in Mecklenburg, and wrote a treatise
	called <cite>The New Medicine of the Spirits</cite>, which he presented to the Royal
	Society of London. An edition of this work was printed in 1673, in which
	the author maintained that a magnetic influence took place, not only
	between the celestial and terrestrial bodies, but between all living
	things. The whole world, he said, was under the influence of magnetism;
	life was preserved by magnetism; death was the consequence of magnetism!</p>

	<p>Maxwell, the other enthusiast, was an admiring disciple of Paracelsus, and
	boasted that he had irradiated the obscurity in which too many of the
	wonder-working recipes of that great philosopher were enveloped. His works
	were printed at Frankfort in 1679. It would seem, from the following
	passage, that he was aware of the great influence of imagination, as well
	in the production as in the cure of diseases. “If you wish to work
	prodigies,” says he, “abstract from the materiality of beings—increase
	the sum of spirituality in bodies—rouse the spirit from its slumbers.
	Unless you do one or other of these things—unless you can bind the idea,
	you can never perform any thing good or great.” Here, in fact, lies the
	whole secret of magnetism, and all delusions of a similar kind: increase
	the spirituality—rouse the spirit from its slumbers, or, in other words,
	work upon the imagination—induce belief and blind confidence, and you may
	do any thing. This passage, which is quoted with approbation by M.
	Dupotet<a href="#fn69" id="fnm69" title="Introduction to the Study..." class="fnmarker">69</a> in a work, as strongly corroborative of the theory now
	advanced by the animal magnetists, is just the reverse. If they believe
	they can work all their wonders by the means so dimly shadowed forth by
	Maxwell, what becomes of the universal fluid pervading all nature, and
	which they pretend to pour into weak and diseased bodies from the tips of
	their fingers?</p>

	<p>Early in the eighteenth century the attention of Europe was directed to a
	very remarkable instance of fanaticism, which has been claimed by the
	animal magnetists as a proof of their science. The <em>Convulsionaries of St.
	Medard</em>, as they were called, assembled in great numbers round the tomb of
	their favourite saint, the Jansenist priest Paris, and taught one another
	how to fall into convulsions. They believed that St. Paris would cure all
	their infirmities; and the number of hysterical women and weak-minded
	persons of all descriptions that flocked to the tomb from far and near was
	so great as daily to block up all the avenues leading to it. Working
	themselves up to a pitch of excitement, they went off one after the other
	into fits, while some of them, still in apparent possession of all their
	faculties, voluntarily <a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274"></a>exposed themselves to sufferings which on
	ordinary occasions would have been sufficient to deprive them of life. The
	scenes that occurred were a scandal to civilisation and to religion—a
	strange mixture of obscenity, absurdity, and superstition. While some were
	praying on bended knees at the shrine of St. Paris, others were shrieking
	and making the most hideous noises. The women especially exerted
	themselves. On one side of the chapel there might be seen a score of them,
	all in convulsions; while at another as many more, excited to a sort of
	frenzy, yielded themselves up to gross indecencies. Some of them took an
	insane delight in being beaten and trampled upon. One in particular,
	according to Montégre, whose account we quote,<a href="#fn70" id="fnm70" title="Dictionaire des Sciences Médicales..." class="fnmarker">70</a> was so enraptured with
	this ill-usage, that nothing but the hardest blows would satisfy her.
	While a fellow of Herculean strength was beating her with all his might
	with a heavy bar of iron, she kept continually urging him to renewed
	exertion. The harder he struck the better she liked it, exclaiming all the
	while, “Well done, brother, well done! Oh, how pleasant it is! what good
	you are doing me! Courage, my brother, courage; strike harder, strike
	harder still!” Another of these fanatics had, if possible, a still greater
	love for a beating. Carré de Montgeron, who relates the circumstance, was
	unable to satisfy her with sixty blows of a large sledge-hammer. He
	afterwards used the same weapon with the same degree of strength, for the
	sake of experiment, and succeeded in battering a hole in a stone wall at
	the twenty-fifth stroke. Another woman, named Sonnet, laid herself down on
	a red-hot brazier without flinching, and acquired for herself the nickname
	of the <em>Salamander</em>; while others, desirous of a more illustrious
	martyrdom, attempted to crucify themselves. M. Deleuze, in his critical
	history of <cite>Animal Magnetism</cite>, attempts to prove that this fanatical
	frenzy was produced by magnetism, and that these mad enthusiasts
	magnetised each other without being aware of it. As well might he insist
	that the fanaticism which tempts the Hindoo bigot to keep his arms
	stretched in a horizontal position till the sinews wither, or his fingers
	closed upon his palms till the nails grow out of the backs of his hands,
	is also an effect of magnetism!</p>

	<p>For a period of sixty or seventy years magnetism was almost wholly
	confined to Germany. Men of sense and learning devoted their attention to
	the properties of the loadstone; and one Father Hell, a Jesuit, and
	professor of astronomy at the University of Vienna, rendered himself
	famous by his magnetic cures. About the year 1771 or 1772 he invented
	steel-plates of a peculiar form, which he applied to the naked <a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275"></a>body as a
	cure for several diseases. In the year 1774 he communicated his system to
	Anthony Mesmer. The latter improved upon the ideas of Father Hell,
	constructed a new theory of his own, and became the founder of <span class="special_name">Animal
	Magnetism</span>.</p>

	<p>It has been the fashion among the enemies of the new delusion to decry
	Mesmer as an unprincipled adventurer, while his disciples have extolled
	him to the skies as a regenerator of the human race. In nearly the same
	words as the Rosicrucians applied to their founders, he has been called
	the discoverer of the secret which brings man into more intimate connexion
	with his Creator, the deliverer of the soul from the debasing trammels of
	the flesh, the man who enables us to set time at defiance, and conquer the
	obstructions of space. A careful sifting of his pretensions, and
	examination of the evidence brought forward to sustain them, will soon
	shew which opinion is the more correct. That the writer of these pages
	considers him in the light of a man who, deluding himself, was the means
	of deluding others, may be inferred from his finding a place in these
	volumes, and figuring among the Flamels, the Agrippas, the Borris, the
	Böhmens, and the Cagliostros.</p>

	<p>He was born in May 1734, at Mersburg, in Swabia, and studied medicine at
	the University of Vienna. He took his degrees in 1766, and chose the
	influence of the planets on the human body as the subject of his inaugural
	dissertation. Having treated the matter quite in the style of the old
	astrological physicians, he was exposed to some ridicule both then and
	afterwards. Even at this early period some faint ideas of his great theory
	were germinating in his mind. He maintained in his dissertation “that the
	sun, moon, and fixed stars mutually affect each other in their orbits;
	that they cause and direct in our earth a flux and reflux not only in the
	sea, but in the atmosphere, and affect in a similar manner all organised
	bodies through the medium of a subtile and mobile fluid, which pervades
	the universe, and associates all things together in mutual intercourse and
	harmony.” This influence, he said, was particularly exercised on the
	nervous system, and produced two states, which he called <em>intension</em> and
	<em>remission</em>, which seemed to him to account for the different periodical
	revolutions observable in several maladies. When in after-life he met with
	Father Hell, he was confirmed by that person’s observations in the truth
	of many of his own ideas. Having caused Hell to make him some magnetic
	plates, he determined to try experiments with them himself for his further
	satisfaction.</p>

	<p>He tried accordingly, and was astonished at his success. The faith of
	their wearers operated wonders with the metallic plates. Mesmer <a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276"></a>made due
	reports to Father Hell of all he had done, and the latter published them
	as the results of his own happy invention, and speaking of Mesmer as a
	physician whom he had employed to work under him. Mesmer took offence at
	being thus treated, considering himself a far greater personage than
	Father Hell. He claimed the invention as his own, accused Hell of a breach
	of confidence, and stigmatised him as a mean person, anxious to turn the
	discoveries of others to his own account. Hell replied, and a very pretty
	quarrel was the result, which afforded small talk for months to the
	literati of Vienna. Hell ultimately gained the victory. Mesmer, nothing
	daunted, continued to promulgate his views till he stumbled at last upon
	the animal theory.</p>

	<p>One of his patients was a young lady, named Œsterline, who suffered under
	a convulsive malady. Her attacks were periodical, and attended by a rush
	of blood to the head, followed by delirium and syncope. These symptoms he
	soon succeeded in reducing under his system of planetary influence, and
	imagined he could foretell the periods of accession and remission. Having
	thus accounted satisfactorily to himself for the origin of the disease,
	the idea struck him that he could operate a certain cure if he could
	ascertain beyond doubt, what he had long believed, that there existed
	between the bodies which compose our globe an action equally reciprocal
	and similar to that of the heavenly bodies, by means of which he could
	imitate artificially the periodical revolutions of the flux and reflux
	before mentioned. He soon convinced himself that this action did exist.
	When trying the metallic plates of Father Hell, he thought their efficacy
	depended on their form; but he found afterwards that he could produce the
	same effects without using them at all, merely by passing his hands
	downwards towards the feet of the patient, even when at a considerable
	distance.</p>

	<p>This completed the theory of Mesmer. He wrote an account of his discovery
	to all the learned societies of Europe, soliciting their investigation.
	The Academy of Sciences at Berlin was the only one that answered him, and
	their answer was any thing but favourable to his system or flattering to
	himself. Still he was not discouraged. He maintained to all who would
	listen to him that the magnetic matter, or fluid, pervaded all the
	universe—that every human body contained it, and could communicate the
	superabundance of it to another by an exertion of the will. Writing to a
	friend from Vienna, he said, “I have observed that the magnetic is almost
	the same thing as the electric fluid, and that it may be propagated in the
	same manner, by means of intermediate bodies. Steel is not the only
	substance adapted to this purpose. I have rendered paper, bread, wool,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277"></a>silk, stones, leather, glass, wood, men, and dogs—in short, every thing I
	touched, magnetic to such a degree, that these substances produced the
	same effects as the loadstone on diseased persons. I have charged jars
	with magnetic matter in the same way as is done with electricity.”</p>

	<p>Mesmer did not long find his residence at Vienna as agreeable as he
	wished. His pretensions were looked upon with contempt or indifference,
	and the case of Mademoiselle Œsterline brought him less fame than
	notoriety. He determined to change his sphere of action, and travelled
	into Swabia and Switzerland. In the latter country he met with the
	celebrated Father Gassner, who, like Valentine Greatraks, amused himself
	by casting out devils, and healing the sick by merely laying hands upon
	them. At his approach, delicate girls fell into convulsions, and
	hypochondriacs fancied themselves cured. His house was daily besieged by
	the lame, the blind, and the hysteric. Mesmer at once acknowledged the
	efficacy of his cures, and declared that they were the obvious result of
	his own newly-discovered power of magnetism. A few of the father’s
	patients were forthwith subjected to the manipulations of Mesmer, and the
	same symptoms were induced. He then tried his hand upon some paupers in
	the hospitals of Berne and Zurich, and succeeded, according to his own
	account, but no other person’s, in curing an opththalmia and a gutta
	serena. With memorials of these achievements he returned to Vienna, in the
	hope of silencing his enemies, or at least forcing them to respect his
	newly-acquired reputation, and to examine his system more attentively.</p>

	<p>His second appearance in that capital was not more auspicious than the
	first. He undertook to cure a Mademoiselle Paradis, who was quite blind,
	and subject to convulsions. He magnetised her several times, and then
	declared that she was cured; at least, if she was not, it was her fault
	and not his. An eminent oculist of that day, named Barth, went to visit
	her, and declared that she was as blind as ever; while her family said she
	was as much subject to convulsions as before. Mesmer persisted that she
	was cured. Like the French philosopher, he would not allow facts to
	interfere with his theory.<a href="#fn71" id="fnm71" title="An enthusiastic philosopher..." class="fnmarker">71</a> He declared that there was a conspiracy
	against him; and that Mademoiselle Paradis, at the instigation of her
	family, feigned blindness in order to injure his reputation!</p>

	<p>The consequences of this pretended cure taught Mesmer that <a class="pagenum" id="page278" title="278"></a>Vienna
	was not the sphere for him. Paris, the idle, the debauched, the
	pleasure-hunting, the novelty-loving, was the scene for a philosopher like
	him, and thither he repaired accordingly. He arrived at Paris in 1778, and
	began modestly by making himself and his theory known to the principal
	physicians. At first, his encouragement was but slight; he found people
	more inclined to laugh at than to patronise him. But he was a man who had
	great confidence in himself, and of a perseverance which no difficulties
	could overcome. He hired a sumptuous apartment, which he opened to all
	comers who chose to make trial of the new power of nature. M. D’Eslon, a
	physician of great reputation, became a convert; and from that time,
	animal magnetism, or, as some called it, mesmerism, became the fashion in
	Paris. The women were quite enthusiastic about it, and their admiring
	tattle wafted its fame through every grade of society. Mesmer was the
	rage; and high and low, rich and poor, credulous and unbelieving, all
	hastened to convince themselves of the power of this mighty magician, who
	made such magnificent promises. Mesmer, who knew as well as any man living
	the influence of the imagination, determined that, on that score, nothing
	should be wanting to heighten the effect of the magnetic charm. In all
	Paris, there was not a house so charmingly furnished as Monsieur Mesmer’s.
	Richly-stained glass shed a dim religious light on his spacious saloons,
	which were almost covered with mirrors. Orange-blossoms scented all the
	air of his corridors; incense of the most expensive kinds burned in
	antique vases on his chimney-pieces; æolian harps sighed melodious music
	from distant chambers; while sometimes a sweet female voice, from above or
	below, stole softly upon the mysterious silence that was kept in the
	house, and insisted upon from all visitors. “<em>Was ever any thing so
	delightful!</em>” cried all the Mrs. Wittitterleys of Paris, as they thronged
	to his house in search of pleasant excitement; “<em>So wonderful!</em>” said the
	pseudo-philosophers, who would believe anything if it were the fashion;
	“<em>So amusing!</em>” said the worn-out debauchés, who had drained the cup of
	sensuality to its dregs, and who longed to see lovely women in
	convulsions, with the hope that they might gain some new emotions from the
	sight.</p>

	<p>The following was the mode of operation: In the centre of the saloon was
	placed an oval vessel, about four feet in its longest diameter, and one
	foot deep. In this were laid a number of wine-bottles, filled with
	magnetised water, well corked-up, and disposed in radii, with their necks
	outwards. Water was then poured into the vessel so as just to cover the
	bottles, and filings of iron were thrown in occasionally to heighten the
	magnetic effect. The vessel was then covered with an <a class="pagenum" id="page279" title="279"></a>iron cover,
	pierced through with many holes, and was called the <em>baquet</em>. From each
	hole issued a long movable rod of iron, which the patients were to apply
	to such parts of their bodies as were afflicted. Around this <em>baquet</em> the
	patients were directed to sit, holding each other by the hand, and
	pressing their knees together as closely as possible, to facilitate the
	passage of the magnetic fluid from one to the other.</p>

	<p>Then came in the assistant magnetisers, generally strong, handsome young
	men, to pour into the patient from their finger-tips fresh streams of the
	wondrous fluid. They embraced the patient between the knees, rubbed them
	gently down the spine and the course of the nerves, using gentle pressure
	upon the breasts of the ladies, and staring them out of countenance to
	magnetise them by the eye! All this time the most rigorous silence was
	maintained, with the exception of a few wild notes on the harmonica or the
	piano-forte, or the melodious voice of a hidden opera-singer swelling
	softly at long intervals. Gradually the cheeks of the ladies began to
	glow, their imaginations to become inflamed; and off they went, one after
	the other, in convulsive fits. Some of them sobbed and tore their hair,
	others laughed till the tears ran from their eyes, while others shrieked
	and screamed and yelled till they became insensible altogether.</p>

	<p>This was the crisis of the delirium. In the midst of it, the chief actor
	made his appearance, waving his wand, like Prospero, to work new wonders.
	Dressed in a long robe of lilac-coloured silk richly embroidered with gold
	flowers, bearing in his hand a white magnetic rod, and with a look of
	dignity which would have sat well on an eastern caliph, he marched with
	solemn strides into the room. He awed the still sensible by his eye, and
	the violence of their symptoms diminished. He stroked the insensible with
	his hands upon the eye-brows and down the spine; traced figures upon their
	breast and abdomen with his long white wand, and they were restored to
	consciousness. They became calm, acknowledged his power, and said they
	felt streams of cold or burning vapour passing through their frames,
	according as he waved his wand or his fingers before them.</p>

	<p>“It is impossible,” says M. Dupotet, “to conceive the sensation which
	Mesmer’s experiments created in Paris. No theological controversy, in the
	earlier ages of the Catholic Church, was ever conducted with greater
	bitterness.” His adversaries denied the discovery; some calling him a
	quack, others a fool, and others again, like the Abbé Fiard, a man who had
	sold himself to the Devil! His friends were as extravagant in their
	praise, as his foes were in their censure. Paris was inundated with
	pamphlets upon the subject, as many defending as attacking the doctrine.
	At court, the queen expressed <a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280"></a>herself in favour of it, and nothing
	else was to be heard of in society.</p>

	<p>By the advice of M. D’Eslon, Mesmer challenged an examination of his
	doctrine by the Faculty of Medicine. He proposed to select twenty-four
	patients, twelve of whom he would treat magnetically, leaving the other
	twelve to be treated by the faculty according to the old and approved
	methods. He also stipulated that, to prevent disputes, the government
	should nominate certain persons who were not physicians, to be present at
	the experiments; and that the object of the inquiry should be, not how
	these effects were produced, but whether they were really efficacious in
	the cure of any disease. The faculty objected to limit the inquiry in this
	manner, and the proposition fell to the ground.</p>

	<p>Mesmer now wrote to Marie Antoinette, with the view of securing her
	influence in obtaining for him the protection of government. He wished to
	have a château and its lands given to him, with a handsome yearly income,
	that he might be enabled to continue his experiments at leisure,
	untroubled by the persecution of his enemies. He hinted the duty of
	governments to support men of science, and expressed his fear, that if he
	met no more encouragement, he should be compelled to carry his great
	discovery to some other land more willing to appreciate him. “In the eyes
	of your majesty,” said he, “four or five hundred thousand francs, applied
	to a good purpose, are of no account. The welfare and happiness of your
	people are every thing. My discovery ought to be received and rewarded
	with a munificence worthy of the monarch to whom I shall attach myself.”
	The government at last offered him a pension of twenty thousand francs,
	and the cross of the order of St. Michael, if he had made any discovery in
	medicine, and would communicate it to physicians nominated by the king.
	The latter part of the proposition was not agreeable to Mesmer. He feared
	the unfavourable report of the king’s physicians; and, breaking off the
	negotiation, spoke of his disregard of money, and his wish to have his
	discovery at once recognised by the government. He then retired to Spa, in
	a fit of disgust, upon pretence of drinking the waters for the benefit of
	his health.</p>

	<p>After he had left Paris, the Faculty of Medicine called upon M. D’Eslon,
	for the third and last time, to renounce the doctrine of animal magnetism,
	or be expelled from their body. M. D’Eslon, so far from doing this,
	declared that he had discovered new secrets, and solicited further
	examination. A royal commission of the Faculty of Medicine was, in
	consequence, appointed on the 12th of March 1784, seconded by another
	commission of the Académie des Sciences, to investigate the phenomena and
	report upon them. The first commission <a class="pagenum" id="page281" title="281"></a>was composed of the
	principal physicians of Paris; while, among the eminent men comprised in
	the latter, were Benjamin Franklin, Lavoisier, and Bailly the historian of
	astronomy. Mesmer was formally invited to appear before this body, but
	absented himself from day to day, upon one pretence or another. M. D’Eslon
	was more honest, because he thoroughly believed in the phenomena, which it
	is to be questioned if Mesmer ever did, and regularly attended the
	sittings and performed experiments.</p>

	<p>Bailly has thus described the scenes of which he was a witness in the
	course of this investigation. “The sick persons, arranged in great numbers
	and in several rows around the <em>baquet</em>, receive the magnetism, by all
	these means: by the iron rods which convey it to them from the
	<em>baquet</em>—by the cords wound round their bodies—by the connexion of the
	thumb, which conveys to them the magnetism of their neighbours—and by the
	sounds of a piano-forte, or of an agreeable voice, diffusing the magnetism
	in the air. The patients were also directly magnetised by means of the
	finger and wand of the magnetiser moved slowly before their faces, above
	or behind their heads, and on the diseased parts, always observing the
	direction of the holes. The magnetiser acts by fixing his eyes on them.
	But above all, they are magnetised by the application of his hands and the
	pressure of his fingers on the hypochondres and on the regions of the
	abdomen; an application often continued for a long time—sometimes for
	several hours.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Meanwhile the patients in their different conditions present a very
		varied picture. Some are calm, tranquil, and experience no effect. Others
		cough, spit, feel slight pains, local or general heat, and have sweatings.
		Others again are agitated and tormented with convulsions. These
		convulsions are remarkable in regard to the number affected with them, to
		their duration and force. As soon as one begins to be convulsed, several
		others are affected. The commissioners have observed some of these
		convulsions last more than three hours. They are accompanied with
		expectorations of a muddy viscous water, brought away by violent efforts.
		Sometimes streaks of blood have been observed in this fluid. These
		convulsions are characterised by the precipitous, involuntary motion of
		all the limbs, and of the whole body; by the contraction of the throat—by
		the leaping motions of the hypochondria and the epigastrium—by the
		dimness and wandering of the eyes—by piercing shrieks, tears, sobbing,
		and immoderate laughter. They are preceded or followed by a state of
		langour or reverie, a kind of depression, and sometimes drowsiness. The
		smallest sudden noise occasions a shuddering; and it was remarked, that
		the change of measure in the airs played on the piano-forte had <a class="pagenum" id="page282" title="282"></a>a
		great influence on the patients. A quicker motion, a livelier melody,
		agitated them more, and renewed the vivacity of their convulsions.</p>

		<p>“Nothing is more astonishing than the spectacle of these convulsions. One
		who has not seen them can form no idea of them. The spectator is as much
		astonished at the profound repose of one portion of the patients as at the
		agitation of the rest—at the various accidents which are repeated, and at
		the sympathies which are exhibited. Some of the patients may be seen
		devoting their attention exclusively to one another, rushing towards each
		other with open arms, smiling, soothing, and manifesting every symptom of
		attachment and affection. All are under the power of the magnetiser; it
		matters not in what state of drowsiness they may be, the sound of his
		voice—a look, a motion of his hand—brings them out of it. Among the
		patients in convulsions there are always observed a great many women, and
		very few men.”<a href="#fn72" id="fnm72" title="Rapport des Commissaires..." class="fnmarker">72</a></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>These experiments lasted for about five months. They had hardly commenced,
	before Mesmer, alarmed at the loss both of fame and profit, determined to
	return to Paris. Some patients of rank and fortune, enthusiastic believers
	in his doctrine, had followed him to Spa. One of them named Bergasse,
	proposed to open a subscription for him, of one hundred shares, at one
	hundred louis each, on condition that he would disclose his secret to the
	subscribers, who were to be permitted to make whatever use they pleased of
	it. Mesmer readily embraced the proposal; and such was the infatuation,
	that the subscription was not only filled in a few days, but exceeded by
	no less a sum than one hundred and forty thousand francs.</p>

	<p>With this fortune he returned to Paris, and recommenced his experiments,
	while the royal commission continued theirs. His admiring pupils, who had
	paid him so handsomely for his instructions, spread his fame over the
	country, and established in all the principal towns of France, “Societies
	of Harmony,” for trying experiments and curing all diseases by means of
	magnetism. Some of these societies were a scandal to morality, being
	joined by profligate men of depraved appetites, who took a disgusting
	delight in witnessing young girls in convulsions. Many of the pretended
	magnetisers were asserted at the time to be notorious libertines, who took
	that opportunity of gratifying their passions.</p>

	<p>At last the commissioners published their report, which was drawn up by
	the illustrious and unfortunate Bailly. For clearness of reasoning and
	strict impartiality it has never been surpassed. After detailing <a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283"></a>the
	various experiments made, and their results, they came to the conclusion
	that the only proof advanced in support of animal magnetism was the
	effects it produced on the human body—that those effects could be
	produced without passes or other magnetic manipulations—that all these
	manipulations and passes and ceremonies never produce any effect at all if
	employed without the patient’s knowledge; and that therefore imagination
	did, and animal magnetism did not, account for the phenomena.</p>

	<p>This report was the ruin of Mesmer’s reputation in France. He quitted
	Paris shortly after, with the three hundred and forty thousand francs
	which had been subscribed by his admirers, and retired to his own country,
	where he died in 1815, at the advanced age of eighty-one. But the seeds he
	had sown fructified of themselves, nourished and brought to maturity by
	the kindly warmth of popular credulity. Imitators sprang up in France,
	Germany, and England, more extravagant than their master, and claiming
	powers for the new science which its founder had never dreamt of. Among
	others, Cagliostro made good use of the delusion in extending his claims
	to be considered a master of the occult sciences. But he made no
	discoveries worthy to be compared to those of the Marquis de Puysegur and
	the Chevalier Barbarin, honest men, who began by deceiving themselves
	before they deceived others.</p>

	<p>The Marquis de Puysegur, the owner of a considerable estate at Busancy,
	was one of those who had entered into the subscription for Mesmer. After
	that individual had quitted France, he retired to Busancy, with his
	brother, to try animal magnetism upon his tenants, and cure the country
	people of all manner of diseases. He was a man of great simplicity and
	much benevolence, and not only magnetised but fed the sick that flocked
	around him. In all the neighbourhood, and indeed within a circumference of
	twenty miles, he was looked upon as endowed with a power almost divine.
	His great discovery, as he called it, was made by chance. One day he had
	magnetised his gardener; and observing him to fall into a deep sleep, it
	occurred to him that he would address a question to him, as he would have
	done to a natural somnambulist. He did so, and the man replied with much
	clearness and precision. M. de Puysegur was agreeably surprised: he
	continued his experiments, and found that, in this state of magnetic
	somnambulism, <em>the soul of the sleeper was enlarged, and brought into more
	intimate communion with all nature, and more especially with him, M. de
	Puysegur</em>. He found that all further manipulations were unnecessary; that,
	without speaking or making any sign, he could convey his will to the
	patient; that he could, in fact, converse <a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284"></a>with him, soul to soul,
	without the employment of any physical operation whatever!</p>

	<p>Simultaneously with this marvellous discovery he made another, which
	reflects equal credit upon his understanding. Like Valentine Greatraks, he
	found it hard work to magnetise all that came—that he had not even time
	to take the repose and relaxation which were necessary for his health. In
	this emergency he hit upon a clever expedient. He had heard Mesmer say
	that he could magnetise bits of wood: why should he not be able to
	magnetise a whole tree? It was no sooner thought than done. There was a
	large elm on the village green at Busancy, under which the peasant girls
	used to dance on festive occasions, and the old men to sit, drinking their
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin du pays</em>, on the fine summer evenings. M. de Puysegur proceeded to
	this tree and magnetised it, by first touching it with his hands, and then
	retiring a few steps from it; all the while directing streams of the
	magnetic fluid from the branches toward the trunk, and from the trunk
	toward the root. This done, he caused circular seats to be erected round
	it, and cords suspended from it in all directions. When the patients had
	seated themselves, they twisted the cords round the diseased parts of
	their bodies, and held one another firmly by their thumbs to form a direct
	channel of communication for the passage of the fluid.</p>

	<p>M. de Puysegur had now two “hobbies”—the man with the enlarged soul and
	the magnetic elm. The infatuation of himself and his patients cannot be
	better expressed than in his own words. Writing to his brother, on the
	17th of May 1784, he says, “If you do not come, my dear friend, you will
	not see my extraordinary man, for his health is now almost quite restored.
	I continue to make use of the happy power for which I am indebted to M.
	Mesmer. Every day I bless his name; for I am very useful, and produce many
	salutary effects on all the sick poor in the neighbourhood. They flock
	around my tree; there were more than one hundred and thirty of them this
	morning. It is the best <em>baquet</em> possible; <em>not a leaf of it but
	communicates health!</em> all feel, more or less, the good effects of it. You
	will be delighted to see the charming picture of humanity which this
	presents. I have only one regret—it is, that I cannot touch all who come.
	But my magnetised man—my intelligence—sets me at ease. He teaches me
	what conduct I should adopt. According to him, it is not at all necessary
	that I should touch every one; a look, a gesture, even a wish, is
	sufficient. And it is one of the most ignorant peasants of the country
	that teaches me this! When he is in a crisis, I know of nothing more
	profound, more prudent, more clearsighted (<em>clairvoyant</em>) than he is.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285"></a>In another letter, describing his first experiment with the
	magnetic tree, he says, “Yesterday evening I brought my first patient to
	it. As soon as I had put the cord round him he gazed at the tree; and,
	with an air of astonishment which I cannot describe, exclaimed, ‘What is
	it that I see there?’ His head then sunk down, and he fell into a perfect
	fit of somnambulism. At the end of an hour, I took him home to his house
	again, when I restored him to his senses. Several men and women came to
	tell him what he had been doing. He maintained it was not true; that, weak
	as he was, and scarcely able to walk, it would have been scarcely possible
	for him to have gone down stairs and walked to the tree. To-day I have
	repeated the experiment on him, and with the same success. I own to you
	that my head turns round with pleasure to think of the good I do. Madame
	de Puysegur, the friends she has with her, my servants, and, in fact, all
	who are near me, feel an amazement, mingled with admiration, which cannot
	be described; but they do not experience the half of my sensations.
	Without my tree, which gives me rest, and which will give me still more, I
	should be in a state of agitation, inconsistent, I believe, with my
	health. I exist too much, if I may be allowed to use the expression.”</p>

	<p>In another letter, he descants still more poetically upon his gardener
	with the enlarged soul. He says, “It is from this simple man, this tall
	and stout rustic, twenty-three years of age, enfeebled by disease, or
	rather by sorrow, and therefore the more predisposed to be affected by any
	great natural agent,—it is from this man, I repeat, that I derive
	instruction and knowledge. When in the magnetic state, he is no longer a
	peasant who can hardly utter a single sentence; he is a being, to describe
	whom I cannot find a name. I need not speak; <em>I have only to think before
	him, when he instantly understands and answers me</em>. Should any body come
	into the room, he sees him, if I desire it (but not else), and addresses
	him, and says what I wish to say; not indeed exactly as I dictate to him,
	but as truth requires. When he wants to add more than I deem it prudent
	strangers should hear, I stop the flow of his ideas, and of his
	conversation in the middle of a word, and give it quite a different turn!”</p>

	<p>Among other persons attracted to Busancy by the report of these
	extraordinary occurrences was M. Cloquet, the Receiver of Finance. His
	appetite for the marvellous being somewhat insatiable, he readily believed
	all that was told him by M. de Puysegur. He also has left a record of what
	he saw, and what he credited, which throws a still clearer light upon the
	progress of the delusion.<a href="#fn73" id="fnm73" title="Introduction to the Study..." class="fnmarker">73</a> He says that the patients he saw in the
	magnetic state had an appearance of deep sleep, <a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286"></a>during which all
	the physical faculties were suspended, to the advantage of the
	intellectual faculties. The eyes of the patients were closed, the sense of
	hearing was abolished; and they awoke only at the voice of their
	magnetiser. “If any one touched a patient during a crisis, or even the
	chair on which he was seated,” says M. Cloquet, “it would cause him much
	pain and suffering, and throw him into convulsions. During the crisis,
	they possess an extraordinary and supernatural power, by which, on
	touching a patient presented to them, they can feel what part of his body
	is diseased, even by merely passing their hand over the clothes.” Another
	singularity was, that these sleepers who could thus discover diseases, see
	into the interior of other men’s stomachs, and point out remedies,
	remembered absolutely nothing after the magnetiser thought proper to
	disenchant them. The time that elapsed between their entering the crisis
	and their coming out of it was obliterated. Not only had the magnetiser
	the power of making himself heard by the somnambulists, but he could make
	them follow him by merely pointing his finger at them from a distance,
	though they had their eyes the whole time completely closed.</p>

	<p>Such was animal magnetism under the auspices of the Marquis de Puysegur.
	While he was exhibiting these phenomena around his elm-tree, a magnetiser
	of another class appeared in Lyons, in the person of the Chevalier de
	Barbarin. This gentleman thought the effort of the will, without any of
	the paraphernalia of wands or <em>baquets</em>, was sufficient to throw patients
	into the magnetic sleep. He tried it and succeeded. By sitting at the
	bedside of his patients, and praying that they might be magnetised, they
	went off into a state very similar to that of the persons who fell under
	the notice of M. de Puysegur. In the course of time a very considerable
	number of magnetisers, acknowledging Barbarin for their model, and called
	after him Barbarinists, appeared in different parts, and were believed to
	have effected some remarkable cures. In Sweden and Germany this sect of
	fanatics increased rapidly, and were called <em>spiritualists</em>, to
	distinguish them from the followers of M. de Puysegur, who were called
	<em>experimentalists</em>. They maintained that all the effects of animal
	magnetism, which Mesmer believed to be producible by a magnetic fluid
	dispersed through nature, were produced by the mere effort of one human
	soul acting upon another; that when a connexion had once been established
	between a magnetiser and his patient, the former could communicate his
	influence to the latter from any distance, even hundreds of miles, by the
	will. One of them thus described the blessed state of a magnetic patient:
	“In such a man animal instinct ascends to the highest degree admissible in
	this world. The <em>clairvoyant</em> is then a pure animal, <a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287"></a>without any
	admixture of matter. His observations are those of a spirit. He is similar
	to God: his eye penetrates all the secrets of nature. When his attention
	is fixed on any of the objects of this world—on his disease, his death,
	his well-beloved, his friends, his relations, his enemies—in spirit he
	sees them acting; he penetrates into the causes and the consequences of
	their actions; he becomes a physician, a prophet, a divine!”<a href="#fn74" id="fnm74" title="See Foreign Review..." class="fnmarker">74</a></p>

	<p>Let us now see what progress these mysteries made in England. In the year
	1788 Dr. Mainauduc, who had been a pupil, first of Mesmer, and afterwards
	of D’Eslon, arrived in Bristol, and gave public lectures upon magnetism.
	His success was quite extraordinary. People of rank and fortune hastened
	from London to Bristol to be magnetised, or to place themselves under his
	tuition. Dr. George Winter, in his <cite>History of Animal Magnetism</cite>, gives
	the following list of them: “They amounted to one hundred and
	twenty-seven, among whom there were one duke, one duchess, one
	marchioness, two countesses, one earl, one baron, three baronesses, one
	bishop, five right honourable gentlemen and ladies, two baronets, seven
	members of parliament, one clergyman, two physicians, seven surgeons,
	besides ninety-two gentlemen and ladies of respectability.” He afterwards
	established himself in London, where he performed with equal success.</p>

	<p>He began by publishing proposals to the ladies for the formation of a
	Hygeian Society. In this paper he vaunted highly the curative effects of
	animal magnetism, and took great credit to himself for being the first
	person to introduce it into England, and thus concluded: “As this method
	of cure is not confined to sex or college education, and the fair sex
	being in general the most sympathising part of the creation, and most
	immediately concerned in the health and care of its offspring, I think
	myself bound in gratitude to you, ladies, for the partiality you have
	shewn me in midwifery, to contribute, as far as lies in my power, to
	render you additionally useful and valuable to the community. With this
	view I propose forming my Hygeian Society, to be incorporated with that of
	Paris. As soon as twenty ladies have given in their names, the day shall
	be appointed for the first meeting at my house, when they are to pay
	fifteen guineas, which will include the whole expense.”</p>

	<p>Hannah More, in a letter addressed to Horace Walpole in September 1788,
	speaks of the “demoniacal mummeries” of Dr. Mainauduc, and says he was in
	a fair way of gaining a hundred thousand pounds by them, as Mesmer had
	done by his exhibitions in Paris.</p>

	<p>So much curiosity was excited by the subject, that, about the same time, a
	man named Holloway gave a course of lectures on animal <a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288"></a>magnetism
	in London, at the rate of five guineas for each pupil, and realised a
	considerable fortune. Loutherbourg the painter and his wife followed the
	same profitable trade; and such was the infatuation of the people to be
	witnesses of their strange manipulations, that at times upwards of three
	thousand persons crowded around their house at Hammersmith, unable to gain
	admission. The tickets sold at prices varying from one to three guineas.
	Loutherbourg performed his cures by the touch, after the manner of
	Valentine Greatraks, and finally pretended to a divine mission. An account
	of his miracles, as they were called, was published in 1789, entitled <cite>A
	List of New Cures performed by Mr. and Mrs. de Loutherbourg, of
	Hammersmith Terrace, without Medicine; by a Lover of the Lamb of God.
	Dedicated to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury</cite>.</p>

	<p>This “Lover of the Lamb of God” was a half-crazy old woman, named Mary
	Pratt, who conceived for Mr. and Mrs. de Loutherbourg a veneration which
	almost prompted her to worship them. She chose for the motto of her
	pamphlet a verse in the thirteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:
	“Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish! for I will work a work in
	your days which ye shall not believe, though a man declare it unto you.”
	Attempting to give a religious character to the cures of the painter, she
	thought a <em>woman</em> was the proper person to make them known, since the
	apostle had declared that a <em>man</em> should not be able to conquer the
	incredulity of the people. She stated, that from Christmas 1788 to July
	1789, De Loutherbourg and his wife had cured two thousand people, “having
	been made <em>proper recipients to receive divine manuductions</em>; which
	heavenly and divine influx, coming from the radix <em>God</em>, his Divine
	Majesty had most graciously bestowed upon them to diffuse healing to all,
	be they deaf, dumb, blind, lame, or halt.”</p>

	<p>In her dedication to the Archbishop of Canterbury she implored him to
	compose a new form of prayer, to be used in all churches and chapels, that
	nothing might impede this inestimable gift from having its due course. She
	further entreated all the magistrates and men of authority in the land to
	wait on Mr. and Mrs. de Loutherbourg, to consult with them on the
	immediate erection of a large hospital, with a pool of Bethesda attached
	to it. All the magnetisers were scandalised at the preposterous jabber of
	this old woman, and De Loutherbourg appears to have left London to avoid
	her,—continuing, however, in conjunction with his wife, the fantastic
	tricks which had turned the brain of this poor fanatic, and deluded many
	others who pretended to more sense than she had.</p>

	<p>From this period until 1798 magnetism excited little or no attention in
	England. An attempt to revive the belief in it was made in <a class="pagenum" id="page289" title="289"></a>that
	year, but it was in the shape of mineral rather than of animal magnetism.
	One Benjamin Douglas Perkins, an American, practising as a surgeon in
	Leicester Square, invented and took out a patent for the celebrated
	“Metallic Tractors.” He pretended that these tractors, which were two
	small pieces of metal strongly magnetised, something resembling the steel
	plates which were first brought into notice by Father Hell, would cure
	gout, rheumatism, palsy, and, in fact, almost every disease the human
	frame was subject to, if applied externally to the afflicted part, and
	moved about gently, touching the surface only. The most wonderful stories
	soon obtained general circulation, and the press groaned with pamphlets,
	all vaunting the curative effects of the tractors, which were sold at five
	guineas the pair. Perkins gained money rapidly. Gouty subjects forgot
	their pains in the presence of this new remedy; the rheumatism fled at its
	approach; and toothache, which is often cured by the mere sight of a
	dentist, vanished before Perkins and his marvellous steel-plates. The
	benevolent Society of Friends, of whose body he was a member, warmly
	patronised the invention. Desirous that the poor, who could not afford to
	pay Mr. Perkins five guineas, or even five shillings for his tractors,
	should also share in the benefits of that sublime discovery, they
	subscribed a large sum, and built an hospital, called the “Perkinean
	Institution,” in which all comers might be magnetised free of cost. In the
	course of a few months they were in very general use, and their lucky
	inventor in possession of five thousand pounds.</p>

	<p>Dr. Haygarth, an eminent physician at Bath, recollecting the influence of
	imagination in the cure of disease, hit upon an expedient to try the real
	value of the tractors. Perkins’s cures were too well established to be
	doubted; and Dr. Haygarth, without gain-saying them, quietly, but in the
	face of numerous witnesses, exposed the delusion under which people
	laboured with respect to the curative medium. He suggested to Dr. Falconer
	that they should make wooden tractors, paint them to resemble the steel
	ones, and see if the very same effects would not be produced. Five
	patients were chosen from the hospital in Bath, upon whom to operate. Four
	of them suffered severely from chronic rheumatism in the ankle, knee,
	wrist, and hip; and the fifth had been afflicted for several months with
	the gout. On the day appointed for the experiments Dr. Haygarth and his
	friends assembled at the hospital, and with much solemnity brought forth
	the fictitious tractors. Four out of the five patients said their pains
	were immediately relieved; and three of them said they were not only
	relieved but very much benefited. One felt his knee warmer, and said he
	could walk across the room. He tried and succeeded, although on the
	previous day he had not been <a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290"></a>able to stir. The gouty man felt his
	pains diminish rapidly, and was quite easy for nine hours, until he went
	to bed, when the twitching began again. On the following day the real
	tractors were applied to all the patients, when they described their
	symptoms in nearly the same terms.</p>

	<p>To make still more sure, the experiment was tried in the Bristol
	infirmary, a few weeks afterwards, on a man who had a rheumatic affection
	in the shoulder, so severe as to incapacitate him from lifting his hand
	from his knee. The fictitious tractors were brought and applied to the
	afflicted part, one of the physicians, to add solemnity to the scene,
	drawing a stop-watch from his pocket to calculate the time exactly, while
	another, with a pen in his hand, sat down to write the change of symptoms
	from minute to minute as they occurred. In less than four minutes the man
	felt so much relieved, that he lifted his hand several inches without any
	pain in the shoulder!</p>

	<p>An account of these matters was published by Dr. Haygarth, in a small
	volume entitled, <cite>Of the Imagination, as a Cause and Cure of Disorders,
	exemplified by fictitious Tractors</cite>. The exposure was a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</em> to
	the system of Mr. Perkins. His friends and patrons, still unwilling to
	confess that they had been deceived, tried the tractors upon sheep, cows,
	and horses, alleging that the animals received benefit from the metallic
	plates, but none at all from the wooden ones. But they found nobody to
	believe them; the Perkinean institution fell into neglect; and Perkins
	made his exit from England, carrying with him about ten thousand pounds,
	to soothe his declining years in the good city of Pennsylvania.</p>

	<p>Thus was magnetism laughed out of England for a time. In France the
	revolution left men no leisure for studying it. The <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sociétés de
	l’Harmonie</em> of Strasbourg, and other great towns lingered for a while,
	till sterner matters occupying men’s attention, they were one after the
	other abandoned, both by pupils and professors. The system, thus driven
	from the first two nations of Europe, took refuge among the dreamy
	philosophers of Germany. There the wonders of the magnetic sleep grew more
	and more wonderful every day; the patients acquired the gift of prophecy;
	their vision extended over all the surface of the globe; they could hear
	and see with their toes and fingers, and read unknown languages, and
	understand them too, by merely having the book placed on their stomachs.
	Ignorant peasants, when once entranced by the grand mesmeric fluid, could
	spout philosophy diviner than Plato ever wrote, descant upon the mysteries
	of the mind with more eloquence and truth than the profoundest
	metaphysicians the world ever saw, and solve knotty points of divinity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291"></a>with as much ease as waking men could undo their shoe-buckles!</p>

	<p>During the first twelve years of the present century little was heard of
	animal magnetism in any country of Europe. Even the Germans forgot their
	airy fancies, recalled to the knowledge of this every-day world by the
	roar of Napoleon’s cannon and the fall or the establishment of kingdoms.
	During this period a cloud of obscurity hung over the science, which was
	not dispersed until M. Deleuze published, in 1813, his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Critique
	du Magnétisme Animal</cite>. This work gave a new impulse to the half-forgotten
	fancy. Newspapers, pamphlets, and books again waged war upon each other on
	the question of its truth or falsehood; and many eminent men in the
	profession of medicine recommenced inquiry with an earnest design to
	discover the truth.</p>

	<p>The assertions made in the celebrated treatise of Deleuze are thus summed
	up:<a href="#fn75" id="fnm75" title="See the very clear..." class="fnmarker">75</a> “There is a fluid continually escaping from the human body,” and
	“forming an atmosphere around us,” which, as “it has no determined
	current,” produces no sensible effects on surrounding individuals. It is,
	however, “capable of being directed by the will;” and, when so directed,
	“is sent forth in currents,” with a force corresponding to the energy we
	possess. Its motion is “similar to that of the rays from burning bodies;”
	“it possesses different qualities in different individuals.” It is capable
	of a high degree of concentration, “and exists also in trees.” The will of
	the magnetiser, “guided by a motion of the hand, several times repeated in
	the same direction,” can fill a tree with this fluid. Most persons, when
	this fluid is poured into them from the body and by the will of the
	magnetiser, “feel a sensation of heat or cold” when he passes his hand
	before them, without even touching them. Some persons, when sufficiently
	charged with this fluid, fall into a state of somnambulism, or magnetic
	ecstasy; and when in this state, “they see the fluid encircling the
	magnetiser like a halo of light, and issuing in luminous streams from his
	mouth and nostrils, his head and hands, possessing a very agreeable smell,
	and communicating a particular taste to food and water.”</p>

	<p>One would think that these “notions” were quite enough to be insisted upon
	by any physician who wished to be considered sane; but they form only a
	small portion of the wondrous things related by M. Deleuze. He further
	said, “When magnetism produces somnambulism, the person who is in this
	state acquires a prodigious extension of all his faculties. Several of his
	external organs, especially those of sight and hearing, become inactive;
	but the sensations which <a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292"></a>depend upon them take place internally.
	Seeing and hearing are carried on by the magnetic fluid, which transmits
	the impressions immediately, and without the intervention of any nerves or
	organs directly to the brain. Thus the somnambulist, though his eyes and
	ears are closed, not only sees and hears, but sees and hears much better
	than he does when awake. In all things he feels the will of the
	magnetiser, although that will be not expressed. He sees into the interior
	of his own body, and the most secret organisation of the bodies of all
	those who may be put <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</em>, or in magnetic connexion, with him.
	Most commonly, he only sees those parts which are diseased and disordered,
	and intuitively prescribes a remedy for them. He has prophetic visions and
	sensations, which are generally true, but sometimes erroneous. He
	expresses himself with astonishing eloquence and facility. He is not free
	from vanity. He becomes a more perfect being of his own accord for a
	certain time, if guided wisely by the magnetiser, but wanders if he is
	ill-directed.”</p>

	<p>According to M. Deleuze, any person could become a magnetiser and produce
	these effects, by conforming to the following conditions, and acting upon
	the following rules:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Forget for a while all your knowledge of physics and metaphysics.</p>

		<p>“Remove from your mind all objections that may occur.</p>

		<p>“Imagine that it is in your power to take the malady in hand, and throw it
		on one side.</p>

		<p>“<em>Never reason for six weeks after you have commenced the study.</em></p>

		<p>“Have an active desire to do good; a firm belief in the power of
		magnetism, and an entire confidence in employing it. In short, repel all
		doubts; desire success, and act with simplicity and attention.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>That is to say, “be very credulous; be very persevering; reject all past
	experience, and do not listen to reason,” and you are a magnetiser after
	M. Deleuze’s own heart.</p>

	<p>Having brought yourself into this edifying state, “remove from the patient
	all persons who might be troublesome to you; keep with you only the
	necessary witnesses—a single person if need be; desire them not to occupy
	themselves in any way with the processes you employ and the effects which
	result from them, but to join with you in the desire of doing good to your
	patient. Arrange yourself so as neither to be too hot nor too cold, and in
	such a manner that nothing may obstruct the freedom of your motions; and
	take precautions to prevent interruption during the sitting. Make your
	patient then sit as commodiously as possible, and place yourself opposite
	to him, on a seat a little more elevated, in such a manner that his knees
	may be betwixt yours, and your feet at the side of his. First, request him
	to resign himself; to think of nothing; not to <a class="pagenum" id="page293" title="293"></a>perplex himself by
	examining the effects which may be produced; to banish all fear; to
	surrender himself to hope, and not to be disturbed or discouraged if the
	action of magnetism should cause in him momentary pains. After having
	collected yourself, take his thumbs between your fingers in such a way
	that the internal part of your thumbs may be in contact with the internal
	part of his, <em>and then fix your eyes upon him</em>! You must remain from two
	to five minutes in this situation, or until you feel an equal heat between
	your thumbs and his. This done, you will withdraw your hands, removing
	them to the right and left; and at the same time turning them till their
	internal surface be outwards, and you will raise them to the height of the
	head. You will now place them upon the two shoulders, and let them remain
	there about a minute; afterwards drawing them gently along the arms to the
	extremities of the fingers, touching very slightly as you go. You will
	renew this pass five or six times, always turning your hands, and removing
	them a little from the body before you lift them. You will then place them
	above the head; and after holding them there for an instant, lower them,
	passing them before the face, at the distance of one or two inches, down
	to the pit of the stomach. There you will stop them two minutes also,
	putting your thumbs upon the pit of the stomach and the rest of your
	fingers below the ribs. You will then descend slowly along the body to the
	knees, or rather, if you can do so without deranging yourself, to the
	extremity of the feet. You will repeat the same processes several times
	during the remainder of the sitting. You will also occasionally approach
	your patient, so as to place your hands behind his shoulders, in order to
	descend slowly along the spine of the back and the thighs, down to the
	knees or the feet. After the first passes, you may dispense with putting
	your hands upon the head, and may make the subsequent passes upon the
	arms, beginning at the shoulders, and upon the body, beginning at the
	stomach.”</p>

	<p>Such was the process of magnetising recommended by Deleuze. That delicate,
	fanciful, and nervous women, when subjected to it, should have worked
	themselves into convulsions will be readily believed by the sturdiest
	opponent of animal magnetism. To sit in a constrained posture—be stared
	out of countenance by a fellow who enclosed her knees between his, while
	he made <em>passes</em> upon different parts of her body, was quite enough to
	throw any weak woman into a fit, especially if she were predisposed to
	hysteria, and believed in the efficacy of the treatment. It is just as
	evident that those of stronger minds and healthier bodies should be sent
	to sleep by the process. That these effects have been produced by these
	means, there are thousands of instances to shew. But are they testimony in
	favour <a class="pagenum" id="page294" title="294"></a>of animal magnetism?—do they prove the existence of the
	magnetic fluid? It needs neither magnetism, nor ghost from the grave, to
	tell us that silence, monotony, and long recumbency in one position, must
	produce sleep; or that excitement, imitation, and a strong imagination
	acting upon a weak body, will bring on convulsions.</p>

	<p>M. Deleuze’s book produced quite a sensation in France; the study was
	resumed with redoubled vigour. In the following year, a journal was
	established devoted exclusively to the science, under the title of
	<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales du Magnétisme Animal</cite>; and shortly afterwards appeared the
	<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque du Magnétisme Animal</cite>, and many others. About the same time,
	the Abbé Faria, “the man of wonders,” began to magnetise; and the belief
	being that he had more of the mesmeric fluid about him, and a stronger
	will, than most men, he was very successful in his treatment. His
	experiments afford a convincing proof that imagination can operate all,
	and the supposed fluid none, of the results so confidently claimed as
	evidence of the new science. He placed his patients in an arm-chair; told
	them to shut their eyes; and then, in a loud commanding voice, pronounced
	the single word, “Sleep!” He used no manipulations whatever—had no
	<em>baquet</em>, or conductor of the fluid; but he nevertheless succeeded in
	causing sleep in hundreds of patients. He boasted of having in his time
	produced five thousand somnambulists by this method. It was often
	necessary to repeat the command three or four times; and if the patient
	still remained awake, the abbé got out of the difficulty by dismissing him
	from the chair, and declaring that he was incapable of being acted on. And
	it should be especially remarked that the magnetisers do not lay claim to
	universal efficacy for their fluid; the strong and the healthy cannot be
	magnetised; the incredulous cannot be magnetised; those who reason upon it
	cannot be magnetised; those who firmly believe in it can be magnetised;
	the weak in body can be magnetised, and the weak in mind can be
	magnetised. And lest, from some cause or other, individuals of the latter
	classes should resist the magnetic charm, the apostles of the science
	declare that there are times when even <em>they</em> cannot be acted upon; the
	presence of one scorner or unbeliever may weaken the potency of the fluid
	and destroy its efficacy. In M. Deleuze’s instructions to a magnetiser, he
	expressly says, “Never magnetise before inquisitive persons!”<a href="#fn76" id="fnm76" title="Histoire Critique..." class="fnmarker">76</a></p>

	<p>Here we conclude the subject, as it would serve no good purpose to extend
	to greater length the history of Animal Magnetism; especially at a time
	when many phenomena, the reality of which it is impossible to dispute, are
	daily occurring to startle and perplex the <a class="pagenum" id="page295" title="295"></a>most learned,
	impartial, and truth-loving of mankind. Enough, however, has been stated
	to shew, that if there be some truth in magnetism, there has been much
	error, misconception, and exaggeration. Taking its history from the
	commencement, it can hardly be said to have been without its uses. To
	quote the words of Bailly, in 1784, “Magnetism has not been altogether
	unavailing to the philosophy which condemns it: it is an additional fact
	to record among the errors of the human mind, and a great experiment on
	the strength of the imagination.” Over that vast inquiry of the influence
	of mind over matter,—an inquiry which the embodied intellect of mankind
	will never be able to fathom completely,—it will at least have thrown a
	feeble and imperfect light. It will have afforded an additional proof of
	the strength of the unconquerable will, and the weakness of matter as
	compared with it; another illustration of the words of the inspired
	Psalmist, that “we are fearfully and wonderfully made.”</p>

	</div>
	
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> famous declaration of St. Paul, “that long hair was a shame unto a
	man,” has been made the pretext for many singular enactments, both of
	civil and ecclesiastical governments. The fashion of the hair and the cut
	of the beard were state questions in France and England, from the
	establishment of Christianity until the fifteenth century.</p>

	<p>We find, too, that in much earlier times, men were not permitted to do as
	they liked with their own hair. Alexander the Great thought that the
	beards of the soldiery afforded convenient handles for the enemy to lay
	hold of, preparatory to cutting off their heads; and, with a view of
	depriving them of this advantage, he ordered the whole of his army to be
	closely shaven. His notions of courtesy <a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297"></a>towards an enemy were quite
	different from those entertained by the North American Indians, and
	amongst whom it is held a point of honour to allow one “chivalrous lock”
	to grow, that the foe, in taking the scalp, may have something to catch
	hold of.</p>
	
	<p>At one time, long hair was the symbol of sovereignty in Europe. We learn
	from Gregory of Tours, that, among the successors of Clovis, it was the
	exclusive privilege of the royal family to have their hair long and
	curled. The nobles, equal to kings in power, would not shew any
	inferiority in this respect, and wore not only their hair, but their
	beards of an enormous length. This fashion lasted, with but slight
	changes, till the time of Louis the Debonnaire; but his successors, up to
	Hugh Capet, wore their hair short, by way of distinction. Even the serfs
	had set all regulation at defiance, and allowed their locks and beards to
	grow.</p>

	<p>At the time of the invasion of England by William the Conqueror, the
	Normans wore their hair very short. Harold, in his progress towards
	Hastings, sent forward spies to view the strength and number of the enemy.
	They reported, amongst other things, on their return, that “the host did
	almost seem to be priests, because they had all their face and both their
	lips shaven.” The fashion among the English at the time was to wear the
	hair long upon the head and the upper lip, but to shave the chin. When the
	haughty victors had divided the broad lands of the Saxon thanes and
	franklins among them, when tyranny of every kind was employed to make the
	English feel that they were indeed a subdued and broken nation, the latter
	encouraged the growth of their hair, that they might resemble as little as
	possible their cropped and shaven masters.</p>

	<p>This fashion was exceedingly displeasing to the clergy, and prevailed to a
	considerable extent in France and Germany. Towards the end of the eleventh
	century, it was decreed by the pope, and zealously supported by the
	ecclesiastical authorities all over Europe, that such persons as wore long
	hair should be excommunicated while living, and not be prayed for when
	dead. William of Malmesbury relates, that the famous St. Wulstan, Bishop
	of Worcester, was peculiarly indignant whenever he saw a man with long
	hair. He declaimed against the practice as one highly immoral, criminal,
	and beastly. He continually carried a small knife in his pocket, and
	whenever any body offending in this respect knelt before him to receive
	his blessing, he would whip it out slily, and cut off a handful, and then,
	throwing it in his face, tell him to cut off all the rest, or he would go
	to hell.</p>

	<p>But fashion, which at times it is possible to move with a wisp, stands
	firm against a lever; and men preferred to run the risk of <a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298"></a>damnation to
	parting with the superfluity of their hair. In the time of Henry I.,
	Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, found it necessary to republish the
	famous decree of excommunication and outlawry against the offenders; but,
	as the court itself had begun to patronise curls, the fulminations of the
	Church were unavailing. Henry I. and his nobles wore their hair in long
	ringlets down their backs and shoulders, and became a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandalum magnatum</em>
	in the eyes of the godly. One Serlo, the king’s chaplain, was so grieved
	in spirit at the impiety of his master, that he preached a sermon from the
	well-known text of St. Paul before the assembled court, in which he drew
	so dreadful a picture of the torments that awaited them in the other
	world, that several of them burst into tears, and wrung their hair, as if
	they would have pulled it out by the roots. Henry himself was observed to
	weep. The priest, seeing the impression he had made, determined to strike
	while the iron was hot, and pulling a pair of scissors from his pocket,
	cut the king’s hair in presence of them all. Several of the principal
	courtiers consented to do the like, and for a short time long hair
	appeared to be going out of fashion. But the courtiers thought, after the
	first glow of their penitence had been cooled by reflection, that the
	clerical Delilah had shorn them of their strength, and in less than six
	months they were as great sinners as ever.</p>

	<p>Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been a monk of Bec, in
	Normandy, and who had signalised himself at Rouen by his fierce opposition
	to long hair, was still anxious to work a reformation in this matter. But
	his pertinacity was far from pleasing to the king, who had finally made up
	his mind to wear ringlets. There were other disputes, of a more serious
	nature, between them; so that when the archbishop died, the king was so
	glad to be rid of him, that he allowed the see to remain vacant for five
	years. Still the cause had other advocates, and every pulpit in the land
	resounded with anathemas against that disobedient and long-haired
	generation. But all was of no avail. Stowe, in writing of this period,
	asserts, on the authority of some more ancient chronicler, “that men,
	forgetting their birth, transformed themselves, by the length of their
	haires, into the semblance of woman kind;” and that when their hair
	decayed from age, or other causes, “they knit about their heads certain
	rolls and braidings of false hair.” At last accident turned the tide of
	fashion. A knight of the court, who was exceedingly proud of his beauteous
	locks, dreamed one night that, as he lay in bed, the devil sprang upon
	him, and endeavoured to choke him with his own hair. He started in
	affright, and actually found that he had a great quantity of hair in his
	mouth. Sorely stricken in conscience, and looking <a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299"></a>upon the dream as a
	warning from heaven, he set about the work of reformation, and cut off his
	luxuriant tresses the same night. The story was soon bruited abroad; of
	course it was made the most of by the clergy, and the knight, being a man
	of influence and consideration, and the acknowledged leader of the
	fashion, his example, aided by priestly exhortations, was very generally
	imitated. Men appeared almost as decent as St. Wulstan himself could have
	wished, the dream of a dandy having proved more efficacious than the
	entreaties of a saint. But, as Stowe informs us, “scarcely was one year
	past, when all that thought themselves courtiers fell into the former
	vice, and contended with women in their long haires.” Henry, the king,
	appears to have been quite uninfluenced by the dreams of others, for even
	his own would not induce him a second time to undergo a cropping from
	priestly shears. It is said, that he was much troubled at this time by
	disagreeable visions. Having offended the Church in this and other
	respects, he could get no sound, refreshing sleep, and used to imagine
	that he saw all the bishops, abbots, and monks of every degree, standing
	around his bed-side, and threatening to belabour him with their pastoral
	staves; which sight, we are told, so frightened him, that he often started
	naked out of his bed, and attacked the phantoms sword in hand. Grimbalde,
	his physician, who, like most of his fraternity at that day, was an
	ecclesiastic, never hinted that his dreams were the result of a bad
	digestion, but told him to shave his head, be reconciled to the Church,
	and reform himself with alms and prayer. But he would not take this good
	advice, and it was not until he had been nearly drowned a year afterwards,
	in a violent storm at sea, that he repented of his evil ways, cut his hair
	short, and paid proper deference to the wishes of the clergy.</p>

	<p>In France, the thunders of the Vatican with regard to long curly hair were
	hardly more respected than in England. Louis VII., however, was more
	obedient than his brother-king, and cropped himself as closely as a monk,
	to the great sorrow of all the gallants of his court. His queen, the gay,
	haughty, and pleasure-seeking Eleanor of Guienne, never admired him in
	this trim, and continually reproached him with imitating, not only the
	head-dress, but the asceticism of the monks. From this cause a coldness
	arose between them. The lady proving at last unfaithful to her shaven and
	indifferent lord, they were divorced, and the kings of France lost the
	rich provinces of Guienne and Poitou, which were her dowry. She soon after
	bestowed her hand and her possessions upon Henry Duke of Normandy,
	afterwards Henry II. of England, and thus gave the English sovereigns that
	strong footing in France which was for so many centuries the cause of such
	long and bloody wars between the nations. <a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300"></a>When the Crusades had drawn all
	the smart young fellows into Palestine, the clergy did not find it so
	difficult to convince the staid burghers who remained in Europe, of the
	enormity of long hair. During the absence of Richard Cœur de Lion, his
	English subjects not only cut their hair close, but shaved their faces.
	William Fitz-osbert, or Long-beard, the great demagogue of that day,
	reintroduced among the people who claimed to be of Saxon origin the
	fashion of long hair. He did this with the view of making them as unlike
	as possible to the citizens and the Normans. He wore his own beard hanging
	down to his waist, from whence the name by which he is best known to
	posterity.</p>

	<p>The Church never shewed itself so great an enemy to the beard as to long
	hair on the head. It generally allowed fashion to take its own course,
	both with regard to the chin and the upper lip. This fashion varied
	continually; for we find that, in little more than a century after the
	time of Richard I., when beards were short, that they had again become so
	long as to be mentioned in the famous epigram made by the Scots who
	visited London in 1327, when David, son of Robert Bruce, was married to
	Joan, the sister of King Edward. This epigram, which was stuck on the
	church-door of St. Peter Stangate, ran as follows:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>“Long beards heartlesse,</p>
		<p>Painted hoods witlesse,</p>
		<p>Gray coats gracelesse,</p>
		<p>Make England thriftlesse.”</p>
	</div>

	<p>When the Emperor Charles V. ascended the throne of Spain he had no beard.
	It was not to be expected that the obsequious parasites who always
	surround a monarch, could presume to look more virile than their master.
	Immediately all the courtiers appeared beardless, with the exception of
	such few grave old men as had outgrown the influence of fashion, and who
	had determined to die bearded as they had lived. Sober people in general
	saw this revolution with sorrow and alarm, and thought that every manly
	virtue would be banished with the beard. It became at the time a common
	saying,—</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p lang="es" xml:lang="es">“Desde que no hay barba, no hay mas alma.”</p>
		<p>We have no longer souls since we have lost our beards.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>In France also the beard fell into disrepute after the death of Henry IV.,
	from the mere reason that his successor was too young to have one. Some of
	the more immediate friends of the great Béarnais, and his minister Sully
	among the rest, refused to part with their beards, notwithstanding the
	jeers of the new generation.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page301" title="301"></a>Who does not remember the division of
	England into the two great parties of Roundheads and Cavaliers? In those
	days every species of vice and iniquity was thought by the Puritans to
	lurk in the long curly tresses of the monarchists, while the latter
	imagined that their opponents were as destitute of wit, of wisdom, and of
	virtue, as they were of hair. A man’s locks were the symbol of his creed,
	both in politics and religion. The more abundant the hair, the more scant
	the faith; and the balder the head, the more sincere the piety.</p>

		<p class="caption">PETER THE GREAT.</p>
	</div>

	<p>But among all the instances of the interference of governments with men’s
	hair, the most extraordinary, not only for its daring, but for its
	success, is that of Peter the Great, in 1705. By this time fashion had
	condemned the beard in every other country in Europe, and with a voice
	more potent than popes or emperors, had banished it from civilised
	society. But this only made the Russians cling more fondly to their
	ancient ornament, as a mark to distinguish them from foreigners, whom they
	hated. Peter, however, resolved that they should be shaven. If he had been
	a man deeply read in history, he might have hesitated before he attempted
	so despotic an attack upon the time-hallowed customs and prejudices of his
	countrymen; but he was not. He did not know or consider the danger of the
	innovation; he only listened to the promptings of his own indomitable
	will, and his fiat went forth, that not only the army, but all ranks of
	citizens, from the nobles to the serfs, should shave their beards. A
	certain time was given, that people might get over the first throes of
	their repugnance, after which every man who chose to retain his beard was
	to pay a tax of one hundred roubles. The priests and the serfs were put on
	a lower footing, and allowed to retain theirs upon payment of a copeck
	every time they passed the gate of a city. Great discontent existed in
	consequence, but the dreadful fate of the Strelitzes was too recent to be
	forgotten, and thousands who had the will had not the courage to revolt.
	As is well remarked by a writer in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, they
	thought it wiser to cut off their beards than to run the risk of incensing
	a man who would make no scruple in cutting off their heads. Wiser, too,
	than the popes and bishops of a <a class="pagenum" id="page302" title="302"></a>former age, he did not threaten them with
	eternal damnation, but made them pay in hard cash the penalty of their
	disobedience. For many years, a very considerable revenue was collected
	from this source. The collectors gave in receipt for its payment a small
	copper coin, struck expressly for the purpose, and called the
	“<em lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">borodováia</em>,” or “the bearded.” On one side it bore the figure of a
	nose, mouth, and moustaches, with a long bushy beard, surmounted by the
	words, “<em lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Deuyee Vyeatee</em>,” “money received;” the whole encircled by a
	wreath, and stamped with the black eagle of Russia. On the reverse, it
	bore the date of the year. Every man who chose to wear a beard was obliged
	to produce this receipt on his entry into a town. Those who were
	refractory, and refused to pay the tax, were thrown into prison.</p>

	<p>Since that day, the rulers of modern Europe have endeavoured to persuade,
	rather than to force, in all matters pertaining to fashion. The Vatican
	troubles itself no more about beards or ringlets, and men may become hairy
	as bears, if such is their fancy, without fear of excommunication or
	deprivation of their political rights. Folly has taken a new start, and
	cultivates the moustache.</p>

	<p>Even upon this point governments will not let men alone. Religion as yet
	has not meddled with it; but perhaps it will; and politics already
	influence it considerably. Before the revolution of 1830, neither the
	French nor Belgian citizens were remarkable for their moustaches; but,
	after that event, there was hardly a shopkeeper either in Paris or
	Brussels whose upper lip did not suddenly become hairy with real or mock
	moustaches. During a temporary triumph gained by the Dutch soldiers over
	the citizens of Louvain, in October 1830, it became a standing joke
	against the patriots, that they shaved their faces clean immediately; and
	the wits of the Dutch army asserted that they had gathered moustaches
	enough from the denuded lips of the Belgians to stuff mattresses for all
	the sick and wounded in their hospital.</p>

	<p>The last folly of this kind is still more recent. In the German
	newspapers, of August 1838, appeared an ordonnance, signed by the king of
	Bavaria, forbidding civilians, on any pretence whatever, to wear
	moustaches, and commanding the police and other authorities to arrest, and
	cause to be shaved, the offending parties. “Strange to say,” adds <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
	Droit</cite>, the journal from which this account is taken, “moustaches
	disappeared immediately, like leaves from the trees in autumn; every body
	made haste to obey the royal order, and not one person was arrested.”</p>

	<p>The king of Bavaria, a rhymester of some celebrity, has taken a good many
	poetical licences in his time. His licence in this matter <a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303"></a>appears neither
	poetical nor reasonable. It is to be hoped that he will not take it into
	his royal head to make his subjects shave theirs; nothing but that is
	wanting to complete their degradation.</p>

An English translation, by a great enthusiast in alchymy, one Richard Russell, was published in London in 1686. The preface is dated eight years previously from the house of the alchymist, “at the Star, in Newmarket, in Wapping, near the Dock.” His design in undertaking the translation was, as he informs us, to expose the false pretences of the many ignorant pretenders to the science who abounded in his day.</p>

			<p>Albert Laski, son of Jaroslav, was Palatine of Siradz, and afterwards of Sendomir, and chiefly contributed to the election of Henry of Valois, the Third of France, to the throne of Poland, and was one of the delegates who went to France in order to announce to the new monarch his elevation to the sovereignty of Poland. After the deposition of Henry, Albert Laski voted for Maximilian of Austria. In 1583 he visited England, when Queen Elizabeth received him with great distinction. The honours which were shewn him during his visit to Oxford, by the especial command of the Queen, were equal to those rendered to sovereign princes. His extraordinary prodigality rendered his enormous wealth insufficient to defray his expenses, and he therefore became a zealous adept in alchymy, and took from England to Poland with him two known alchymists.—Count Valerian Krasinski’s <cite>Historical Sketch of the Reformation in Poland</cite>.</p>

			<p>The following legend of the tomb of Rosencreutz, written by Eustace Budgell, appears in <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 379 of the <cite>Spectator</cite>:—“A certain person, having occasion to dig somewhat deep in the ground where this philosopher lay interred, met with a small door, having a wall on each side of it. His curiosity, and the hope of finding some hidden treasure, soon prompted him to force open the door. He was immediately surprised by a sudden blaze of light, and discovered a very fair vault. At the upper end of it was a statue of a man in armour, sitting by a table, and leaning on his left arm. He held a truncheon in his right hand, and had a lamp burning before him. The man had no sooner set one foot within the vault, than the statue, erecting itself from its leaning posture, stood bolt upright; and, upon the fellow’s advancing another step, lifted up the truncheon in his right hand. The man still ventured a third step; when the statue, with a furious blow, broke the lamp into a thousand pieces, and left his guest in sudden darkness. Upon the report of this adventure, the country people came with lights to the sepulchre, and discovered that the statue, which was made of brass, was nothing more than a piece of clock-work; that the floor of the vault was all loose, and underlaid with several springs, which, upon any man’s entering, naturally produced that which had happened.</p>
			<p>“Rosicreucius, say his disciples, made use of this method to shew the world that he had re-invented the ever-burning lamps of the ancients, though he was resolved no one should reap any advantage from the discovery.”</p>

			<p>Although other places claim the honour(!) of Mother Shipton’s birth, her residence is asserted, by oral tradition, to have been for many years a cottage at Winslow-cum-Shipton, in Buckinghamshire, of which the above is a representation. We give the contents of one of the popular books containing her prophecies:</p>
			<p><cite>The Strange and Wonderful History and Prophecies of Mother Shipton, plainly setting forth her Birth, Life, Death, and Burial.</cite> <abbr title="duodecimo">12mo.</abbr> Newcastle. <abbr title="chapter">Chap.</abbr> 1.—Of her birth and parentage. 2. How Mother Shipton’s mother proved with child; how she fitted the justice, and what happened at her delivery. 3. By what name Mother Shipton was christened, and how her mother went into a monastery. 4. Several other pranks play’d by Mother Shipton in revenge of such as abused her. 5. How Ursula married a young man named Tobias Shipton, and how strangely she discovered a thief. 6. Her prophecy against Cardinal Wolsey. 7. Some other prophecies of Mother Shipton relating to those times. 8. Her prophecies in verse to the Abbot of Beverly. 9. Mother Shipton’s life, death, and burial.</p>

			<p>Let us try. In his second century, prediction 66, he says:</p>
			<div class="poem">
				<p>“From great dangers the captive is escaped.</p>
				<p>A little time, great fortune changed.</p>
				<p>In the palace the people are caught.</p>
				<p>By good augury the city is besieged.”</p>
			</div>
			<p>“What is this,” a believer might exclaim, “but the escape of Napoleon from Elba—his changed fortune, and the occupation of Paris by the allied armies?”</p>
			<p>Let us try again. In his third century, prediction 98, he says:</p>
			<div class="poem">
				<p>“Two royal brothers will make fierce war on each other;</p>
				<p>So mortal shall be the strife between them,</p>
				<p>That each one shall occupy a fort against the other;</p>
				<p>For their reign and life shall be the quarrel.”</p>
			</div>
			<p>Some Lillius Redivivus would find no difficulty in this prediction. To use a vulgar phrase, it is as clear as a pikestaff. Had not the astrologer in view Don Miguel and Don Pedro when he penned this stanza, so much less obscure and oracular than the rest?</p>

			<p>It is quite astonishing to see the great demand there is, both in England and France, for dream-books, and other trash of the same kind. Two books in England enjoy an extraordinary popularity, and have run through upwards of fifty editions in as many years in London alone, besides being reprinted in Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin. One is <cite>Mother Bridget’s Dream-book and Oracle of Fate</cite>; the other is the <cite>Norwood Gipsy</cite>. It is stated, on the authority of one who is curious in these matters, that there is a demand for these works, which are sold at sums varying from a penny to sixpence, chiefly to servant-girls and imperfectly-educated people, all over the country, of upwards of eleven thousand annually; and that at no period during the last thirty years has the average number sold been less than this. The total number during this period would thus amount to 330,000.</p>

			<p>See Van der Mye’s account of the siege of Breda. The garrison, being afflicted with scurvy, the Prince of Orange sent the physicians two or three small phials, containing a decoction of camomile, wormwood, and camphor, telling them to pretend that it was a medicine of the greatest value and extremest rarity, which had been procured with very much danger and difficulty from the East; and so strong, that two or three drops would impart a healing virtue to a gallon of water. The soldiers had faith in their commander; they took the medicine with cheerful faces, and grew well rapidly. They afterwards thronged about the prince in groups of twenty and thirty at a time, praising his skill, and loading him with protestations of gratitude.</p>

			<p>Mummies were of several kinds, and were all of great use in magnetic medicines. Paracelsus enumerates six kinds of mummies; the first four only differing in the composition used by different people for preserving their dead, are the Egyptian, Arabian, Pisasphaltos, and Libyan. The fifth mummy of peculiar power was made from criminals that had been hanged; “for from such there is a gentle siccation, that expungeth the watery humour, without destroying the oil and spirituall, which is cherished by the heavenly luminaries, and strengthened continually by the affluence and impulses of the celestial spirits; whence it may be properly called by the name of constellated or celestial mummie.” The sixth kind of mummy was made of corpuscles, or spiritual effluences, radiated from the living body; though we cannot get very clear ideas on this head, or respecting the manner in which they were caught.—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Diatastica</span>; or, Sympathetical Mummie, abstracted from the Works of Paracelsus, and translated out of the Latin</cite>, by Fernando Parkhurst, Gent.

			<p>An enthusiastic philosopher, of whose name we are not informed, had constructed a very satisfactory theory on some subject or other, and was not a little proud of it. “But the facts, my dear fellow,” said his friend, “the facts do not agree with your theory.”—“Don’t they?” replied the philosopher, shrugging his shoulders, “then, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant pis pour les faits</em>;”—so much the worse for the facts!</p>
